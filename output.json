Students will achieve this by choosing an educational track based on their interests in different fields, such as healthcare, finance, law and advocacy, the arts, and entrepreneurship while learning through real-world internships in their selected track, and community projects.\n\n \n“I cannot adequately express the excitement that I have in playing a role in bringing the school of the future to my hometown,” stated Diallyo Diggs, Co-founder of 24/7 Learning Academy.  “Our team has worked diligently to create a learning institution that will consistently grow and develop with our students and our community.  I hope, through this school, we can demonstrate how truly collaborative education can be and how educating our youth is truly a community activity.”\n\n\nBeing true to its name, 24/7 Learning Academy is changing the concept of the traditional 8-hour school day with an on-site facility open 24/7 by providing students and parents 24/7 access to technological and educational resources.   In addition, 24/7 Learning Academy will offer schedule flexibility which will provide students with the opportunity and time, during school hours, to gain real-life, hands-on experience through internships and participation in community activities, while still attending to their schoolwork.  “By throwing away the convention of an 8-hour school day, our mission is a school that provides our students with a 21st Century education by combining traditional content, real-life skills, and social development 24/7,” says Widlyne Antoine-Filion, Co-founder. \n\n\nXQ: The Super School Project, launched in September 2015, is an open call to rethink and redesign the American High School. Thousands of applicants and tens of thousands of supporters from towns and cities across the country have united to take on this important work. Teams of students, teachers, parents, and community leaders, to name just a few, came together to conceptualize innovative models for 21st-century learning and create a pathway to success for students.\n\n \n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nWelcome to 24/7 Learning Academy - A New High School for Entrepreneurship, Leadership, and Innovation opening in Orlando, Florida\nHave questions?

Over the last year, our team has been hard at work getting ready to prepare our first class of 9th and 10th grade students to become skilled problem solvers, entrepreneurs, college graduates, and leaders of innovation and social justice.\n\nRecently lots of people have asked us the question: “Why do you want to start a new school?” Here’s what it boils down to... \n\nOur team has over 75+ years of education experience in some of the highest performing public and private schools in the U.S., but we’ve all noticed the same thing: Our world is totally different now than it was twenty years ago, but our schools, for the most part, look exactly the same. So many schools do not equip students with the skills that are required to thrive in the 21st century. We want to change that.\n\nSince we started designing the Learning Academy, we have asked ourselves a lot of questions about how schools have traditionally operated and what we can do to improve upon them. Here are just a few of these questions:\n\nWhy are students taught like they’re all exactly the same?\n\nCarrie loves chemistry and physics, has a natural knack for numbers and is passionate about programming robots. Malcolm is a very strong writer and loves to read about politics and current events. Despite very different strengths and interests, their schedules at school most likely look identical. It’s no surprise why so many students find school boring. \n\nAt the 24/7 Learning Academy, we believe that learning should be personalized to match each student’s interests and learning style. With the help of their mentors and advisors, students will have the ability to create a curriculum that includes skill development, internships, projects, and content designed to fuel their passions and love of learning.\n\n\nHow can schools better leverage their communities to help students?\n\nAt 24/7 Learning Academy, our classroom extends far beyond our school walls. In the Orlando community, there are experts in just about every industry you can imagine. \nWhether a student wants to learn more about journalism, engineering, graphic design, or medicine, we will facilitate learning opportunities through things like internships, expert visits, and job shadows.\n\nMost high school students don’t yet know what they want to do professionally, so what better way for them to learn about these industries than to get some meaningful hands-on experience?\n\n\nWhat skills should students be learning in school?\n\nSo often students graduate high school and college unprepared for their professional careers. That’s because no industry requires their workers to memorize facts and take multiple choice tests. \n\nAt 24/7 Learning Academy, we think that what happens in school should reflect what happens in the real world. Our curriculum emphasizes “learning by doing.” Through a variety of projects, students will develop critical skills such as project management, communication, and collaboration that will prepare them for success.\n\nWe look forward to working with students and parents in Orlando and would love to see you at our upcoming open houses (sign up below!) to share more about our school and to hear your thoughts on how we can best serve our students.\n\nTuesday, April 25, 2017 (RSVP)\n\n131 O'Brien Road\n\nFern Park FL 32730\n\n6:30pm – 8:00pm\n\nTuesday, April 18, 2017 (RSVP)\n\n131 O'Brien Road\n\nFern Park FL 32730\n\n6:30pm – 8:00pm\n\nView fullsize\nComments (1)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nAdam Alvarado 6 months ago · 0 Likes\n  \n\nHello matte great blog\n\nPreview POST REPLY\nThe High School for Entrepreneurship and Leadership Development coming to Orlando, Florida\n24/7 Learning Academy Advances to the Finals in the $50 Million XQ: The Super School Project Grant Challenge\nHave questions?

To accomplish our mission of making education relevant and available to all students with a burning passion to launch their own startup or a desire to attend a high school for leadership development, we put a technology-rich spin on the old one-room school house concept.\n\nOur blended-learning model is a high school with project-based learning, rather than centered around traditional grade levels and standardized testing. Mastery-based, student-driving learning objectives guide advancement and skill-based grouping. This ensures a rigorous educational experience that delivers 21st-century skill development focused on entrepreneurship, leadership and social justice.\n\nWhat sets 24/7 Learning Academy apart from a Montessori High School or a traditional private high school in Orlando, Florida is our team approach that includes live online sessions, in-person classes and 1:1 tutoring opportunities with intelligent software. Students experience collaborative and self-guided project assignments and explore personal learning styles, aptitudes and interest. And, we work closely with the community, so all students have access to mentors, specialists, college and career counselors and advisors to help them every step of the way. There are no boring lectures. Instead, Socratic discussions drive home important information and key concepts.\n\nOur educational programming is based on two key factors: 1) every student has unique learning styles and, 2) no two students have identical educational goals and passions. The educational journey should reflect a personalized curriculum that supports comprehension, skills development and access to internships, community service projects, apprenticeships and entrepreneurial opportunities designed to fuel his or her own passion. The 24/7 Learning Academy is a high school for entrepreneurship with additional training around Finance, Law and Advocacy, Culinary Arts and Media Production, Health and Wellness and Agriculture and Alternative Energy because we want each student who leaves the Academy to be fully prepared to enter college or a career. And, we do all this with remote and on-site programs and flexible schedules so students can participate on their own schedule.\n\nMulti-Discipline project-based learning ensures students understand why the content in their personal education plan is relevant, and how they can apply skills acquired to achieve their career objectives and enhance daily life beyond the classroom.\n\nWe look forward to working with students and parents in our local communities and are pleased to announce our new school opening soon in Orlando. Please accept our invitation to visit an open house to learn more.\n\nDate: Tuesday, May 9th, 2017 (RSVP)\nTime: 6:30pm – 8:00pm\n\nJoin us by clicking on the Meeting URL below - (Download is Required)      \nhttps://bluejeans.com/927678031 \n \nMeeting ID: 927678031\n\nJoin us by phone:\n+1.408.740.7256\n+1.408.317.9253\n\nor\n\nDate: Tuesday, May 16th, 2017 (RSVP)\n\nTime: 6:30pm – 8:00pm\n\nJoin us by clicking on the Meeting URL below - (Download is Required)      \nhttps://bluejeans.com/927678031 \n\nMeeting ID: 927678031\n\nJoin us by phone:\n+1.408.740.7256\n+1.408.317.9253\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nCreating an Entrepreneurial Classroom\nWelcome to 24/7 Learning Academy - A New High School for Entrepreneurship, Leadership, and Innovation opening in Orlando, Florida\nHave questions?

In doing so, they are going to get to learn a lot of practical skills and knowledge in agriculture, biology, engineering, and marketing and get to see how they apply to creating something real. \n\nBut even more importantly, they are going to get exposure to many of the challenges they will face in both college and their professional careers. Things like: How do you collaborate with a team to solve a complicated problem when there is no one telling you the solution? How do you manage your limited time and resources? How do you adjust when your first approach doesn’t work? How can you stay motivated in the face of failure? \n\nHigh school is a perfect time to learn these valuable lessons, and we see no reason why an individual has to wait until they are out of college before they can follow their passions and launch a business or pursue their own entrepreneurial paths. In fact, at PS 11 in New York City, students in 3rd grade (Yes eight and nine-year-olds!) operate a weekly farmer’s market and help take care of the chickens whose eggs they sell to the community. \n\nIf we truly want to prepare our students to become great innovators and leaders, what better way to start then to inspire and support them in creating something real?\n\nWe are extremely excited to see what our students create!\n\nClick here to Register for our onsite or virtual high school today!\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nHelp us Build the School of the Future\nThe High School for Entrepreneurship and Leadership Development coming to Orlando, Florida\nHave questions?

Through personalized and project-based learning our students will gain the knowledge and skills they need to be successful.\n\nOur team of educators has over 75 years of experience, and we believe we've designed a school that will have a huge impact on students and communities across the country.\n\nAn essential part of the 24/7 Learning Academy is the ability to have both onsite and remote students learning and participating simultaneously within one classroom. With the right technology, we will have the opportunity to share our classroom and instruction with students across the globe. Both students and instructors can effectively engage in the learning process from any internet ready device, anywhere in the world, in real time.\n\nHowever, financing the right technology for this is difficult. Inexpensive and widely available video conferencing resources currently exist, but they are insufficient for classroom use and experience a plethora of technical issues. We need something more robust and consistent to ensure students have active engagement and participation, regardless of their location.\n\nWe are looking to truly integrate remote students and educators through the use of the Cisco SX80 and SpeakerTrack System, a high definition video and microphone system that includes motion and sound-tracking. This technology will allow us to provide seamless access to our classrooms and instructors.\n\nFamilies no longer have to be limited to the educational choices within their communities, and students no longer have to be subjugated to inexperienced teachers and inadequate instruction because of where they live.\n\nWe need your support; please donate today to help us raise the monies required to purchase this groundbreaking technology and help us share our classrooms and exceptional learning experiences with students and families from across the globe. We appreciate your support and all donations large or small are encouraged.\n\nWe are grateful to all donors, and we want you to see the impact of your gifts, so we are offering the following rewards for donations.\n\n$500: You will receive 24/7 Learning Academy memorabilia, be listed as a Silver sponsor on our website and plaque at our school location. (The Bronze Donor Package)\n\n$1,000: You will receive “The Bronze Donor Package” plus be acknowledged in a live class as a Gold Donor. (The Silver Donor Package)\n\n$1,500: You will receive “The Silver Donor Package” and sponsor a cluster of 3 students and have feedback on their progress and receive a personal letter or video from each of them. (The Gold Donor Package)\n\n$3,000-$5,000: You will receive “The Gold Donor Package,” plus sponsor a particular project that students complete annually, and the project will be named after you. A larger gift ($4,000 or more) will allow you to help select which project that you would like to sponsor. (The Platinum Donor Package)\n\n$8,000 or over: You will receive “The Platinum Donor Package,” plus, we will name a program and Subject Area after you. (The Diamond Donor Package)\n\nDonate today, and become a supporter of a school that is innovating education and changing the lives of its students. If you cannot afford to donate, please help us by sharing our campaign with your friends and family.\n\nThe 24/7 Learning Academy is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization, and all donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\n\nComments (1)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nganar dinero 9 months ago · 0 Likes\n  \n\nThanks for a great reaad\n\nPreview POST REPLY\nWhy did we create the 24/7 Learning Academy?\nCreating an Entrepreneurial Classroom\nHave questions?

An excellent education begins with access to a high-quality educator. The greater the Teacher, the greater the value of the lesson to the student.\n\nSome people may think that is impossible, the problem is too big for our small organization to tackle, and I say \"why not.\"  Technology has made it so that people from across the globe can easily communicate, collaborate, and share information with a touch of a button. Successful corporations use these innovations throughout the world. Why is it so difficult for us to utilize the same technology to transform education so that all students have access to high-quality educators and instruction?   Why doesn’t everyone see this as an opportunity or is the paradigm shift so significant?\n\nEither way, the 24/7 Learning Academy team sees a bigger picture, and yes, it is a giant puzzle that we are completing piece by piece.  To simplify our task, we asked ourselves three questions:\n\nHow can we get the best educators and instruction in front of the most students?\n\nWhat are the most effective ways students learn?\n\nHow can we continually assess the quality of learning taking place in our programs?\n\nBy asking these questions, we know we have to design a classroom that is not limited by walls or location.  We have to focus on pedagogy, content delivery, and how we can assess learning without external impediments.\n\nWe don't have all of the answers, and there are still many challenges to overcome, but we understand that education in its simplest form begins with the educator and student, and the quality of instruction is determined by the quality of the person delivering it.\n\n \n\nINTERESTED IN THE 24/7 LEARNING ACADEMY\nCLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nTHE FUTURE IS HERE AND OUR KIDS NEED TO BE READY FOR IT...

Content is readily available, and self-paced learning is happening all around us. No one person, school, or system controls what we can learn and when.  On-demand learning is everywhere, people learn what they want, when they want, from various sources and the only thing that stops them is a lack of will or drive to learn.  At the 24/7 Learning Academy, the role of the lead teacher (Advisor) is not to just deliver instruction but to:\n\nIncrease effort, engagement, and our student's will to learn\n\nSupport student healthy habits\n\nSupport the Growth Mindset in students and families\n\nProvide leadership development and mentorship\n\nWe believe a quality education starts with access and a healthy mindset, and our first job as educators is to create that safe place where students can experience just that.  The questions our team is examining this month are: \n\nHow can we train our educators to get the most effort from their students?\n\nWhat are the healthy habits students need to succeed?\n\nHow can we increase engagement with students through online and in-person instruction?\n\nHow can we create curriculum and assessments that are continuously improving as our students develop and promote the Growth Mindset?\n\nThese are the questions we are working to answer every day and we believe so should you. \n\nCheck out our latest video that describes some of the amazing things we have accomplished at the 24/7 Learning Academy.\n\n\nSTUDENT SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nSUPPORT OUR \"GET A PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COST\" SCHOLARSHIP FUND FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS\n\nAll students deserve to have access to the best educational experiences possible, but many don't.  All donations small and large will pay for students to participate in our high school or  entrepreneurship and leadership after school program which includes tutoring, test prep, entrepreneurship training, and leadership development for teens.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\n SIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nStudent Portfolios, Transcripts, and College...\nTHE FUTURE IS HERE AND OUR KIDS NEED TO BE READY FOR IT...

Standardized testing and transcripts have proven not be helpful to many students for various reasons, and end up being accurate for a small percentage of kids.\n\nAt the 24/7 Learning Academy, we feel that using digital student portfolios is a more advantageous and accurate way to show student accomplishments.  Transcripts only represent standardized outcomes, and we all know individual students have unique challenges and stories that can’t be explained by a letter grade.  Also, just students with the most resources have the best opportunities to prepare for college-entry standardized tests.  \n\nDigital portfolios changes that and levels the playing field by allowing college admission departments to focus on tangible learning outcomes, reflection, and growth.  Colleges are seeing that companies are looking for candidates who are resourceful, can think outside of the box, show grit, and are now looking for the same characteristics from high school graduates.   \n\nWe understand the need for quantitative results like test scores and grades, but we see them as a small piece of a more substantial body of work that represents a student’s journey through school.  \n\nWe have partnered with a few companies and organizations that support digital portfolio development for students and are looking for more ways for students to accurately display their talents and abilities. \n\nBelow is a list of colleges and universities that accept student portfolios as a part of their admissions process:\n\nAmherst College\n\nBates College\n\nBowdoin College\n\nBrown University\n\nBryn Mawr College\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nCarleton College\n\nClemson University\n\nColby College\n\nColgate University\n\nCollege of the Holy Cross\n\nCollege of William & Mary\n\nColorado College\n\nColumbia University\n\nConnecticut College\n\nCornell University\n\nDartmouth College\n\nDavidson College\n\nDuke University\n\nEmory University\n\nFranklin & Marshall College\n\nFranklin W.

Remember, you are looking for a school that will make the educational experience for your child and you as rewarding as possible.\n\nStep 1: Consider your child & your family\n\nStart your search for the best school by thinking about what you want a school to do and be for your child. Perhaps your child has special language or education needs or has a special talent that needs to be fostered. Keep these in mind. After all, you know your son or daughter better than anyone else does.\n\nYour child's needs:\n\nDoes your child need a more structured environment?\n\nDoes your child need a less structured environment?\n\nDoes your child need more challenging work?\n\nDoes your child need more individual attention?\n\nDoes your child generally need extra help or more time to complete an assignment?\n\nDoes your child have any special learning needs?\n\nDoes your child need an environment that fosters creativity?\n\nDoes your child need an English language acquisition program?\n\nYour child's learning style:\n\nDoes your child learn best by seeing how things work?\n\nDoes your child learn best by reading about how something works?\n\nDoes your child learn best by listening?\n\nDoes your child like to participate in discussions?\n\nDoes your child like to learn through physical activity?\n\nIs your child logical or mathematical?\n\nIs your child musical or artistic?\n\nDoes your child like to learn in groups?\n\nDoes your child like to work alone?\n\nLocation of school:\n\nDo you want your child to go to a school within walking distance of your home?\n\nCan your child's talents be nurtured outside your neighborhood?\n\nHow far are you willing to have your child bused?\n\nHow far are you willing to drive your child to school?\n\nDoes your child want to be in a school with his or her friends?\n\nDo you want your child to go to a school near your after-school care? Near where you work? Near a close relative?\n\nDoes your child have any special transportation needs that must be considered in choosing a school?\n\nStep 2: Gather information about schools\n\n\nIf you were looking to buy a car, you could talk to friends and family and find information on the Internet, in consumer magazines, or in other published resources. Similarly, when investigating schools, you may also have to make phone calls, collect written material from different schools and look for reports in your local paper to get the information you need. You can check public school report cards and go to parent fairs and school open houses. You can find reliable school information online on sites such as www.greatschools.net and www.privateschoolreview.com. The in-depth research will be worth your while if you find a school that brings out the best in your child.\n\nAlong with the schools' curricula and philosophy, you will want to know about school policies and services. Parents may also wish to consider the after-school programs a school offers, for example, sports, clubs, tutoring, or academic enrichment. Some schools have after-school activities funded by the U.S. Department of Education's 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. These centers provide educational activities outside of the regular school hours' before and after school or during summer vacation' that complement what is taught in school. You may also want to ask if the school offers free tutoring, test prep, and technical education programs.\n\nCurriculum\n\nDoes the school have a vigorous program of core academic subjects such as English, history, mathematics, science, arts, and foreign languages?\n\nWhat courses does the school offer in addition to the core subjects?\n\nWhat evidence is there that the school is effectively teaching students to read?\n\nDoes the school have a particular focus or theme for the curriculum?\n\nDoes the school offer challenging courses such as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and high school honors courses?\n\nDoes the school provide enrichment opportunities for all students? For gifted students?\n\nDoes the school have extracurricular activities that support what is taught?\n\nIs there an effective English language acquisition program for children who need it?\n\nIf your child has special learning needs, does the school have a curriculum and the necessary supports to appropriately accommodate those needs?\n\nApproach to learning\n\nDoes the school have a particular approach to teaching and learning (e.g., group projects, individual performance, frequent testing)?\n\nIf yes, do you think your child will enjoy and learn from this approach?\n\nDoes the school do all it can to make sure each child learns? Does it provide opportunities for children to get extra help when they need it?\n\nIs the school staff able to communicate in the language that your child understands?\n\nAre children with limited English language skills, learning disabilities, or other special needs learning and performing well on tests?\n\nWhat is the homework policy? Does it match your expectations for how much homework your child should do?\n\nDo you want your child to go to a single-sex (all-boy or all-girl) school, or a coeducational school?\n\nHow large are the classes?\n\nAcademic performance\n\nHow do the school's test scores compare to those of other schools? (Check the school's report card if it is a public school or ask for information from the school if it is a private school. See 'Parent Tip' on school report cards.)\n\nIn the past few years, have test scores risen or declined?\n\nHow does the school explain the rise or decline? How well have children similar to yours performed on these tests?\n\nHow do students moving on to the next level of schooling perform in their new schools?\n\nHow many students leave the school before completing the last grade?\n\nWhat special achievements or recognition has the school received?\n\nBehavior policy\n\nWhat does the school do to help develop character and citizenship?\n\nWhat is the discipline policy? How does the school handle students who misbehave?\n\nAre teachers fair in their responses to students?

How does the school encourage daily attendance?\n\nDo school personnel call parents when students are absent?\n\nDoes the school have a drug and alcohol abuse prevention program?\n\nDoes the school have a dress code?\n\nDo students wear uniforms?\n\nSafety\n\nIs the school safe?\n\nHow does the school prevent and handle problems with drugs, alcohol, and tobacco?\n\nHow does the school prevent and handle violence, bullying, harassment, and other forms of abusive behavior?\n\nWhat measures does the school take to ensure safety? What security measures are in place?\n\nWhat is the school's relationship with the local police?\n\nIs there a police officer on duty during school hours and for extracurricular activities?\n\nWhat information is available on serious crime in the school?\n\nWhat information is available on students bringing weapons to school?\n\nDoes the school have an emergency plan for local and national emergencies?\n\nWhat does the school do to ensure that parents and all school administrators know the emergency plan?\n\nAre there drills?\n\nHow does the school notify parents about emergency closings? How does the school communicate with parents in other languages?\n\nSpecial offerings\n\nWhat extracurricular activities does the school offer after school or on weekends?\n\nDo all students have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities?\n\nWhat interscholastic activities are available to students?\n\nWhat intramural activities are available to students?\n\nWhat activities receive the most attention and resources?\n\nAre there school and student publications?\n\nDoes the school have field trips?\n\nAre they available to all students?\n\nAre publications for parents available in other languages?\n\nFacilities and services\n\nIs there a well-stocked library where students can check out books and do research?

Breakfast program?\n\nIs supervised before- and after school care offered?\n\nAre there tutoring programs?\n\nAre counseling services available to students?\n\nIs the school accessible to children with mobility limitations?\n\nAdmissions procedures for public schools of choice and private schools\n\nIs there an application process?\n\nWhat is the application deadline?\n\nIs anything else required in the application (test scores, interview, recommendations, application fees, etc.)?\n\nAre test scores required for admission?\n\nWhat are the ranges of scores for admitted students?\n\nDo admissions requirements include a portfolio, an audition or statement of interest?\n\nAre there any other admissions requirements?\n\nAre admissions requirements published in languages other than English?\n\nAdditional questions about private schools\n\nWhat is the tuition?\n\nIs there a payment plan?\n\nIs there a sliding scale for tuition, based on the parish, church affiliation, or family income?\n\nWhat are the other fees and expenses (room and board, uniforms, books, transportation, lab and computer fees, activity fees)?\n\nWhat scholarships and loans are available?\n\nAre students or their parents required to be of a particular faith?\n\nDoes the school have a policy on student participation in religious instruction and worship?\n\nDoes the school close for religious and federal holidays?\n\nDoes the school have the same schedule as the local public school?\n\nAdditional questions about home schools\n\nHave you identified curriculum materials for your child, and how much they will cost?\n\nIs there a suitable place for your child's study and instruction?\n\nDo you, your spouse, or another homeschooling parent have adequate free time to be available to your homeschooling child?\n\nDo other families in your area homeschool their children?\n\nIs there a support group of homeschoolers near you?\n\nIf you are interested in some outside instructional support, have you checked your local library, parks department, scouting organizations, public and private schools, and similar resources?\n\nHave you searched the Web for resources on instruction, legal issues, support groups, and other matters?\n\nHave you identified other resources you will need?\n\nHave you checked state regulations? (They are usually available on the web or from your local public school or school district.)\n\n \nStep 3: Visit and observe schools\n\nContact the schools you are interested in and make an appointment for a visit. If possible, tour the schools during regular school hours and visit a few classes. Avoid visiting schools during the first or last week of a term to get a realistic sense of how the school operates.\n\nAn excellent way to have your questions answered is to schedule an appointment with the school principal. If possible, attend an open house, parent-teacher meeting, or other school function that would also provide valuable information about the attitudes of staff, students, and parents.\n\nListen carefully to what teachers say about the school. The teachers will be the adults closest to your child, and you will want to know if they are well prepared, dedicated, and happy in their work.\n\nCulture\n\nIs the school secretary helpful and friendly?\n\nIs the school orderly and neat?\n\nWhat do the bulletin boards look like?\n\nHow is student work displayed?\n\nHow does the school communicate with students and parents (weekly/monthly newsletter, e-mail, Website)?\n\nDo the students appear to be courteous, happy, and disciplined?\n\nIs there a welcoming attitude toward all parents?\n\nHow are the students with diverse learning needs (e.g., students with disabilities and students with limited English proficiency) treated?\n\nDo the teachers appear to be helpful and friendly?\n\nPrincipal\n\nWhat is the principal's philosophy of education?\n\nWhat is the principal's attitude toward discipline?\n\nIn what extracurricular activities is the principal most interested?\n\nWhat is the principal's reputation in the community?\n\nIs the principal usually at the school and available to talk to parents?\n\nDoes the principal get to know the students?\n\nHow often does the principal observe teachers?\n\nWhat does the school do to keep good teachers and improve teacher performance?\n\nHow does the principal respond to parental concerns/complaints?\n\nWhat is the principal's attitude toward students with diverse learning needs (e.g., students with disabilities and students with limited English proficiency)?\n\nAccording to the principal, what are the school's strengths?\n\nAccording to the principal, what are the school's weaknesses?\n\nAccording to the principal, where can the school improve?\n\nTeachers\n\nHow do teachers grade student work?\n\nDo teachers have high expectations for all students to achieve to high academic standards?\n\nHow do teachers inform students of their expectations?\n\nDo teachers share the course content and objectives with parents?\n\nWhen and how frequently are teachers available for parent conferences?\n\nDo teachers assign homework? Is it rigorous? Frequent? Sufficient?\n\nAre the teachers highly qualified to teach in their subject areas (do they know the subjects they are teaching)?\n\nDo teachers have the skills and knowledge to address students with special learning needs?\n\nAre specialized staffs available to address the individual learning needs of a child (e.g., speech therapist, psychologist or aides)?\n\nDo the teachers know the individual students in their classes?\n\nAre teachers willing to provide extra help to students?\n\nWhat is the school's policy regarding teacher response to parent inquiries?\n\nDo teachers have websites with class notes and other information for students and parents?\n\nStudents\n\nWhat is the attendance rate for students?\n\nWhat do students say about the principal?\n\nWhat do students say about the teachers?\n\nDo the students have school spirit?\n\nWhat do students say about homework?\n\nDo students participate in and enjoy field trips?\n\nDo students feel safe and secure at the school?\n\nWhat do student publications say?\n\nWhat else do students say about the school?\n\nParent and community involvement\n\nHow does the school encourage parental involvement?\n\nWhat are the ways parents can get involved?\n\nAre parents encouraged to volunteer?\n\nDoes the school have an active parent-teacher organization?\n\nDoes the school hold meetings and events at times when parents can attend?\n\nHow well attended are back-to-school nights by parents?\n\nAre families expected to be involved with homework?\n\nHow frequently does the school communicate with parents?\n\nAre community leaders involved with the school?\n\nDoes the school partner with local businesses and organizations?\n\nAre parents involved in the development of school policies?\n\nReputation\n\nHow is the school regarded in the community?\n\nHow is the school viewed by other parents?\n\nIs the school respected by other schools, particularly those that receive its students (when they move to the next level)?\n\nHas the school won any awards?\n\nDo people move to the community to go to the school?\n\nWhat do the graduates of the school say?\n\nHave graduates from the school made significant contributions to the community and their field of choice?\n\n \nStep 4: Apply to the schools you choose\n\nOnce you select the school(s) that you think will be best for your child, you will go through a process of applying to a school (or schools) of your choice and enrolling your child. Consider applying to more than one school, in case your child is not admitted to their first choice.\n\nYou will want to begin this process as early as possible to ensure you meet all the deadlines.\n\nAdmissions processes can vary. Your child may need to be tested or interviewed, and you may need to provide a school transcript, recommendations, or other information. It would be helpful to learn about admissions criteria for the schools. You will want to double check to be sure you have accurate information on when and how to apply.\n\nSelect one or more schools to apply to\n\nTo which schools do you want to apply?\n\nWhat is the application deadline at each school?\n\nSubmit paperwork and applications before the deadlines\n\nHave you filled out the application for each school?\n\nHave you included all of the required additional information with the application (deposit, student transcript, test scores, letters of recommendation)?\n\nHave you submitted applications before the deadline set by each school?\n\nFollow up\n\nHave you contacted each school to check on your child's application status?\n\nWhen will the schools notify you that your child has been admitted?\n\nWhen will you need to notify the school that your child plans to attend?\n\nWhen will you notify the schools that your child will not attend?\n\nYou are ready\n\nCongratulations on all the planning you have done to reach this point. Your child will benefit tremendously from your active concern and involvement with his or her education. By collecting information, talking to other parents, visiting schools, and exercising your right to choose, you can now take the lead in making sure your son or daughter gets the best possible education. However, this is only the beginning. By staying involved in your child's education, encouraging your child to work hard, and providing additional opportunities to learn at home and in the community, you can help your child go further still. Remember it is your right, as well as your responsibility, to seek the very best education for your son or daughter.  Thanks for reading!\n\nDownload our Free School and Student Evaluation Tools today!\n\nThese guides are all you need to understand your child's and Family's needs and choose the right school for your child.\n\n DOWNLOAD FOR FREE\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nArticle Reference:\n\nURL:https://www2.ed.gov/parents/schools/find/choose/pub_pg7.html\n \n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nMentoring is more important than teaching at the 24/7 Learning Academy\nStudent Portfolios, Transcripts, and College...\nHave questions?

Palmer, The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher's Life)\n\nEach week, the members of 247 Learning Academy’s School Design Team meet by conference call to continue the work of supporting the Academy’s success.  We talk about the school’s mission and core principles and work to make sure that the program and practices at the school are aligned with these educational values.  The team has members all along the East Coast - from Miami Florida to Montreal Canada - and we are all professional educators. Combined, the five members of the School Design team have over 75 years of classroom and school administration experience.  Most of us, like most of you reading this post, experienced school as a place where you go to “learn things” - to acquire knowledge. Teachers are responsible for delivering information and helping students develop skills to process information. The longer you stay in school, the more specialized this all becomes until you graduate, hopefully, with enough specialized knowledge to have some value out in the world.\n\nWhen we developed and launched the 247 Learning Academy, we were motivated by the realization that the world was changing fast and current students need something very different from this traditional model of education.  We believe that, in the not-too-distant future, education be much less about “learning things.” Instead, all of us, adults and children, will be accessing readily available information and learning what we need to know when we need to know it.  People will constantly develop skills by doing the tasks at hand, often guided by experts who will have transferred their knowledge to learning platforms. We designed the Learning Academy to be a place where teachers are not handing down or transferring information to students, but guiding them to learn what they need to meet their goals and objectives.  We call our teachers “Mentors” and their role in the Academy is to work with students to develop the mindset, skills, and discipline to be true lifelong learners.\n\nThe difference between “mentoring” and “teaching” was the topic of our last School Design team call.  We were looking for examples from our personal lives where we mentored someone, or when we had a mentor, and we sought distinctions between the two words.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates from the 24/7 Learning Academy.\n\n SIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nHere is what we came up with:\n\nA mentor has a relationship with the person they are mentoring that is grounded in mutual respect with the goal of fostering the growth of the whole person.  A mentor relationship is one of integrity, where integrity is about being whole and fully integrated.\n\nA relationship with a mentor is collaborative.  It is not adversarial or judgemental. Mentors encourage success and set high standards through their own conduct and achievement;  mentors do not “grade” - they guide a person to understand their own performance and make plans for improvement.\n\nA mentor doesn’t tell someone what to do or how to do it.  Mentorship is about giving people the ability to make their own choices, so they can learn and grow as a consequence of their decisions and derive authentic life lessons from their actions.\n\nMentors are people in our lives who allows us to ask the question “why not?”  They open doors by pointing us to the possibilities, and they are people who support us to move forward on our own goals and aspirations.\n\nA relationship with a mentor helps us understand the “why” of learning.  We often seek out mentors who are accomplished or experienced in an area we need or want to grow in.  Even a great teacher will be unable to teach a student who has no desire or interest to learn; a mentor seeks to develop and build upon the intrinsic motivation to learn.\n\nMentorship requires a high degree of mutual trust.  Learning requires pushing into the unknown, and mentors support us through, and encourage us to make, our own mistakes.  Failing becomes part of the process of growing and learning; Mentors create a safe space to try new things and they provide context and perspective on what it really takes to achieve success.\n\nThe experience of having a good mentor will inspire a person to want to mentor others.  Mentorship is about authentic and purpose-driven growth and learning. While many of the lessons taught in a traditional school setting may be disconnected from “real life,” by definition, mentors shepherd us through life’s real challenges and opportunities.\n\nWithout a doubt, many teachers find themselves in mentoring relationships with some of their students, and many mentors “teach” both skills and information.  A fundamental belief of the people who created the 247 Learning Academy is that role of the adults is primarily one of mentorship. Our hope is to guide students to take full responsibility for their own learning. We seek to foster a growth mindset and enable students with the proper skills, tools, and discipline to learn what they need to know, when they need to know it.  We engage students in authentic and challenging projects that will push them beyond what they currently know, and the adults and student work together to complete these projects. This is happening right now, every day, at the 247 Learning Academy. You can learn more about how we do this on our website, or contact the school to set up a visit and see for yourself.\n\n \n\nBy: David Arnstein, SR.

Part 1\n\nThe 247 Learning Academy uses Project Based Learning (PBL) as a central organizing principle for our teaching and learning.  Our commitment to projects is based on the outcomes we plan to see in our students, who, over time, develop the ability to take on increasingly challenging tasks.  This pedagogy, we believe, closely mirrors the expectations, demands, and responsibilities required to engage and succeed in a fast-changing world.  The Academy develops projects that require students to think across academic disciplines, collaborate with each other, develop executive function habits as well as academic skills, and which always end with something being created, completed, and celebrated.  If project-based learning is so effective, why don’t more schools and teachers implement PBL as a part of their regular practice?\n\nFor the past few years, the Curriculum and School Design teams of the 247 Learning Academy have been looking at many questions related to PBL.  What is the proper balance between traditional content and experiential learning?  How many projects can students effectively work on at one time?  How can a teacher manage a classroom where groups of students may be taking their learning in different directions?  What kind of daily, weekly, and yearly schedules best support PBL?  Many of the answers to these questions are reflected in the practices and methods developed by the Learning Academy (check out our website for more information about the unique nature of our school).  One question, however, has presented us with an usually deep and intertwined challenge that we have been untangling during this academic year:  how do teachers assess and give feedback to student’s work on projects?\n\nThe more we engage students in meaningful, authentic, and challenging projects, the less relevant traditional assessments (tests, essays, grades, etc.) become. For instance, this year students at the Academy worked to build a greenhouse in order to grow vegetables for a “Homemade Salsa” company they wanted to start. This project grew out of an earlier project that introduced students to the ideas of entrepreneurialism.  Over the course of the year, students had to learn to develop budgets, build a greenhouse, use spreadsheets, select and grow crops, write a business plan, do some marketing, hone their cooking skills, raise capital, and complete significant amounts of research into a range of topics related to business, health codes, market research, etc.  Students also learned, in a deep and lifelong way, that success and failure are not the same as grades on a test;  in fact, failure, in the context of a project, is simply another learning opportunity. In life, what we do with failure (not achieving a goal/not completing a project) shapes how we learn and grow and succeed.  But how can a teacher “grade” a project such as this?  How can she assess student’s work if they are all doing different parts of the project?  How do you track all the learning that is taking place over the course of a project that may take months to complete?\n\nWhile doing projects inherently provides valuable feedback to students, the Learning Academy is also responsible for assessing learning across a spectrum of metrics, including traditional academic subjects.  To this end, we have been working on a software platform dedicated to Project Based Learning.  We recognized that one of the barriers to implementing PBL in classrooms is the difficult task of evaluating and assessing projects in a comprehensive, data-driven, and timely manner so that students (and their families) can see what learning is taking place and how students are developing skills through their engagement with these projects.    One of the exciting features of this software platform is the ability to create rubric-based grading that provides a flexible, customizable tool for assessing projects.  We’ve been busy creating rubrics that map to state educational standards, common core standards, and a group of skills (often called “21st-century skills”) related to communication, collaboration, organization, presentation, technology use, and other hard-to-measure metrics.  \n\nIn addition to this assessment module, we’ve been working on a set of common principles that form the essential academic core of a good learning project.  As we applied these principles to our projects, what emerged was an approach to PBL that allows anyone interested in using this pedagogy a method of developing, implementing, and assessing projects in “real time.”  That is, the software platform integrates standards-based assessment into project-based learning in a way that provides critical, timely, and comprehensive feedback to students.  We have spent over two years developing this platform, and we are now using it to create, implement, and assess projects at the Learning Academy.  We plan to make this platform available to other teachers and students so we can learn more about the challenges of implementing PBL in classrooms around the world.  We believe that technology has an important role to play in facilitating project-based learning in classrooms… now it is time to see if this idea can work in practice.  If you’re interested in this kind of teaching and learning and would like to try our PBL platform, click here to register for a demonstration and training session with this software.  \n \n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\n SIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nProject Based Learning - Why I am so passionate about it?\nMentoring is more important than teaching at the 24/7 Learning Academy\nHave questions?

It must connect opportunities for learners to improve their executive functions, increase their technical skills and provide a deeper connection to information. \n\nI have led the development of a 10 point PBL design framework that I believe allows for that balance and guides learners of all backgrounds to experience their greatness.  \n\nAlso, I believe the combination of Experiential Learning and Portfolio-based assessments are the most equitable forms of instruction, and all learners should have the opportunity to experience them.\n\nOur organizational objectives now are to make the delivery of those two instructional approaches simple for educators and parents to implement and create access to more equitable forms of instruction. \n\nThis is my why.  What is yours?  \n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nSAT Prep for Homeschoolers: 4 Tips to Ease the Process\nProject Based Learning - Why is it Important to our school...

Although some colleges and universities are beginning to do away with the SAT, over 80% of schools still require either the SAT or the ACT. That percentage is not decreasing as fast as you would hope, so preparation for these tests is still something that needs to be considered.\n\nPerforming well on one of these tests is so important for a homeschool student because it is the only objective indicator that colleges and universities have to assess their abilities as learners.\n\nAt large, homeschool students have very little experience with standardized tests compared to most traditional high school students who have been taking these kinds of tests since third grade. When it comes to preparing for the SAT, homeschool students must also find their own way to learn what topics are covered, and the timing and format of the test.\n\nHowever, the fact that it’s more work for homeschool students doesn’t mean they can’t do just as well as traditional high school students. There are things you can do to make preparation less stressful.\n\nHere are four tips our Test Prep for Life team suggests for easing the process of SAT preparation for a homeschooler:\n\nFigure out your child’s weaknesses. Take advantage of free practice tests provided by the College Board. This will help you identify exactly what your child needs to work on. You can even narrow it down to the specific types of questions they need more practice with. Identifying your child’s strengths and weaknesses first can keep you from taking too much time going over topics your child has already mastered and not enough time on topics they need more help with. Getting a head start with diagnostics will save you both time and money.\n\nFind ways to make studying at home fun. For a 9th or 10th grader who is just beginning the test prep process, create games and activities that include different SAT subjects. Some options are: a jeopardy game that covers math, science and English; a vocabulary bingo game to review words and their definitions; and a Jenga-style game incorporating questions and answers over several topics.\n\nDevelop regular sleep habits and a study schedule. This goes for you and your child. Get on a good sleep schedule, not only because this will prepare your child for not being sleep-deprived on test day, but because it will also help both parties be at their best during study time. Being tired is not conducive to optimal concentration, and it can also make it easier to forget previously reviewed concepts. Choosing the best time of day to study and sticking to it, along with your regular sleep schedule, can help make study time more productive.\n\nInvest in a test prep program. A good test prep program can take a lot of the work and stress off your shoulders. These programs are designed to diagnose your child’s strengths and weaknesses, create a customized study plan and track their progress, review the material covered on the test, and keep you and your child motivated throughout the whole process. There are so many programs out there to choose from, so it is important to find a test prep service that will not only fit your child’s needs but also provide you with the best value for your money. We here at the 24/7 Learning Academy have developed a test prep program that goes beyond SAT preparation: Test Prep for Life.\n\nWhether you enjoy them or not, tests are something that we encounter throughout our life. For homeschoolers, in particular, acquiring test-taking skills is essential.\n\nThat’s why our Test Prep for Life program is so invaluable. By combining project-based learning and the fundamentals of test prep, we have created a program that prepares students for any exam or standardized test. We offer each student exactly what they need through personalized learning. Your child will be able to walk away from our program feeling empowered, with lasting principles that they will be able to apply to every test life throws at them.\n\nTake a look at our flexible options below, and reach out to our test prep experts to find out how Test Prep for Life can prepare your child for their future.\n\nSEE OUR TEST PREP PACKAGES\nComments (1)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nVoices from Gezi 5 months ago · 0 Likes\n  \n\nInteresting tthoughts\n\nPreview POST REPLY\nWhat is Project Based Learning & Will It Work For My Child?\nProject Based Learning - Why I am so passionate about it?\nHave questions?

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENSFOR ADULTSFOR ORGANIZATIONSNEWS & FREE RESOURCESABOUT US\nWhat is Project Based Learning & Will It Work For My Child?\n\nYou may have heard the term Project Based Learning (PBL) used around the internet when looking at educational options for your child. If you’ve explored our website, you’ve seen it mentioned plenty of times. While you may have heard of it, we realize that chances are, you don’t know exactly what it is.\n\nProject Based Learning is a method in which learners work on a project over an extended period of time, anywhere from a week to a semester. The project engages them in solving real-world problems or answering complex questions.\n\nThrough this concentrated work, learners get to demonstrate their knowledge and skills by developing a public product, book, design, presentation, or other tangible outcome. They then go on to share their creative project with a real audience, rather than simply keeping it within the classroom or home.\n\nPBL gives a learner the ability to dive deep into a subject and build their skills so that they not only finish a project, but develop critical thinking faculties, communication skills, and more.\n\nThese are the fundamental skills which will best prepare your child for the future. A traditional school system is built on paper-based assignments, teacher-led instruction, and rote memorization. We believe that PBL is the key to preparing children for true mastery in the 21st century.\n\nWill PBL Work For Your Child?\n\nThe experiential nature of PBL is appropriate for all children, those who learn in a variety of different ways. If “Read, Write & Remember” method of teaching leaves you wanting more, then PBL is for you.\n\nUtilizing critical thinking and creative solutions to problems, PBL encourages your learner to experiment with multiple learning systems and figure out what method works best for them. In this way, PBL truly respects that no two children are the same.\n\nNot only will PBL work for your child, but it will offer them a greater chance of success than traditional test-driven methods because it supports exploration and discovery. Applying the principles of PBL in later life is possible whether your child wants to pursue a general career or take the entrepreneurial route. Because it’s based on things we do every day as adults, PBL is like training for life!\n\nCheck out our Project Based Learning curriculum by clicking the button below.\n\nFIND OUT MORE HERE\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\n5 Benefits of a Year-Round School Calendar\nSAT Prep for Homeschoolers: 4 Tips to Ease the Process\nHave questions?

When it comes to school, one facet of this comfort zone is the traditional school year calendar. In the U.S., we’re accustomed to an academic year that consists of approximately nine months, made up of two semesters or four quarters. We generally have long holiday breaks and a two- to three-month summer, with various days off for teacher planning sprinkled throughout the year.\n\nAt 24/7 Learning Academy, we subscribe to a different philosophy about the ideal academic year. Radical though it may be in comparison to what we’re all used to, a year-round approach to schooling is beneficial for both students and parents. Here are five reasons we love learning all year long.\n\nThere’s no such thing as summer loss. If there’s no summer, there’s no way you can forget everything you learned all year! Parents and teachers alike notice the annual dip in retention and academic enthusiasm. None of our shorter breaks are long enough to result in a negative effect on a learner’s growth.\n\nWe operate in realistic (working world) time. One big letdown when you enter the working world is the fact that work continues year-round. Summer? Spring break? These things don’t exist out in the “real world.” Why not prepare students for the routine they will encounter as adults?\n\nMore hours in class translate into more instructional time. This may not be a plus in the eyes of students, but the more balanced year-round approach to scheduling allows for a greater quantity of teaching time. More time means faster academic progress, with less of a focus on meeting deadlines and checking off learning standards. We are fans of flex time, and this open schedule gives students and teachers alike the creative space they need.\n\nIt’s better for working parents. Summer is a working parent’s logistical nightmare. If you’re not scraping up coins to pay for summer camp, you’re shuffling the kids around to different caregivers every day. Imagine if the school year routine lasted all year! Even if your kids are homeschooled, this can be a lifesaver. We still believe in building in time for family vacations and rest, but the year-round school calendar is much easier on busy families than the old model.\n\nYou can create periods of focused work. Because the rhythm of work and rest is steady, learners can get more done. Knowing you have three or four weeks to get a project done, versus three or four months until summer break, can have a magical effect on motivation. Regular break periods create consistent positive anticipation, always having something to look forward to. It’s the same feeling you get when you know the weekend is coming; it’s a little easier to get things done!\n\nYear-round school may sound like a bummer at first, but the benefits are far-reaching for the whole family, and for busy educators. Check out an example of how this looks for our onsite and virtual middle and high school students.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nHow to Homeschool an Athlete\nWhat is Project Based Learning & Will It Work For My Child?\nHave questions?

Does it seem that there isn’t enough time for them to do both? Here’s my account of how homeschooling was the perfect solution for me as a young competitive athlete.\n\nKids that participate in highly competitive sports often don’t have time to adequately progress as an athlete and attend school simultaneously. Highly motivated athletes that have the desire to reach the top in their sport of choice will simply not be able to attend a traditional school. In order to stay ahead of their competitors, they’ll have to allocate an enormous amount of time to maintain and further their athletic skills.\n\n \n\nHomeschooling or private academies are often the only plausible options. For me, homeschooling was essential in allowing me to relish every moment of my own experience as a teenaged athlete.\n\nAs a World Cup Mogul Skier, I learned that it was difficult to compete at a very high level and keep up with academics along the way. Luckily, I only had to do this for my last year of high school. In order for me to travel the World Cup circuit, being homeschooled seemed to be my only option, as the public school system only allowed a certain number of absences to graduate.\n\nIn my senior year, I started homeschooling. Due to the time required for skiing, it wasn’t feasible to take the same workload that other students take in their senior year of high school. In order to get through, I only completed the minimum requirements to graduate in order to be able to compete at the World Cup level. Without the option of homeschooling, I wouldn’t have been able to compete at all.\n\nThe prominent benefit of the homeschooling curriculum was the fact that there wasn’t a regimented agenda, especially since my schedule was constantly changing. There tended to be two extremes during skiing season: periods of very high stress or practically no stress. Therefore, during training weeks, I was able to allocate half the day to skiing and the rest to school work.\n\nDue to how taxing skiing was on my body, training lasted about three hours at a time. Taking into account all the logistical aspects of getting to and from the mountain and gearing up, we would usually end the day by early afternoon. By that time we would do a cooldown and stretch to make sure our bodies are properly taken care of before the next day’s training. After all that, we would then be able to dedicate a couple hours to school work.\n\nIn contrast to the training schedule were the competitions. At these times, it was beyond difficult to allot any time towards school work due to the already hectic schedule. I didn’t want to tax myself mentally as well as physically. Instead of trying to jam in a few hours of homework, I would leave it aside until the competition was over.\n\nHaving the flexibility to do this was exceptionally helpful to both my athletic and academic performance. Not having to worry about homework gave me a clear head for competitions, and being free of the skiing pressure after competitions allowed me to focus more on my scholastic goals. In a traditional school environment, I wouldn’t have had this luxury.\n\nAthletic pursuits are nothing but positive for a child’s character development. The extraordinary circumstances of a crazy training schedule shouldn’t limit the quality of education a student receives.\n\n*This post was written by our Marketing Superstar and World Cup Skier Colin Lang*\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nWhy Homeschooling Could Be the Answer for Your Family\n5 Benefits of a Year-Round School Calendar\nHave questions?

If you’re facing the question of whether homeschooling could be the answer, it can be helpful to step back and look at things objectively.\n\nThis discovery process can surface doubts, largely because you haven’t been exposed to the full picture of what’s possible within the realm of homeschooling. Although we hear success stories about public or private school graduates, it’s rare to hear rave reviews of homeschooling in a public forum. Yet despite not being as commonly publicized, homeschooling has had a positive influence on many successful people.\n\nFrom celebrities like Justin Timberlake and Will Smith, to historical figures such as Susan B Anthony and Thomas Edison, and prodigies such as Mozart and Serena Williams, homeschooling has made an undeniable impact, and it could do the same for your child.\n\nStill, making the decision to homeschool means confronting the widely praised advantages of public schooling: cost (or lack thereof), activities, and socialization, to name just a few. Public schools provide free education and transportation, a variety of clubs and sports, and daily interaction with others from similar backgrounds. It’s hard to fight against these obvious assets and the sheer dominance of public schools in American culture.\n\nHowever, parents like you are seeking alternatives to public education in growing numbers. It turns out there are numerous reasons for this trend. Dissatisfaction with our public education system acts as a catalyst, but collectively, you are motivated to seek alternatives based on a range of additional factors. You may have a desire to focus on a career or athletic pursuit, maintain control over the quality of your child’s education, or work around limiting financial means that make private school unreachable.\n\nShould unique circumstances require it, homeschooling can provide your learner the time he or she needs to hone specialized skills or interests such as acting or sports. Homeschooling nurtures a passion for artistic or athletic pursuits more fully than a traditional school environment.\n\nOnce you decide to homeschool, you’ll have the freedom to choose a specialized curriculum, which is essential if your child has special needs or learning disabilities. Even if this is not the case, there is no replacement for autonomy as a parent educator.\n\nCompared to private school tuition, homeschooling is an affordable option. It’s possible to create a full-bodied education at home by piecing together online curriculum, participation in homeschooling co-ops and other local groups, and age-appropriate educational excursions.\n\nNo matter your particular reason for becoming dissatisfied with the public school system, homeschooling may be the answer for your family. We recommend reading success stories and discussing options with other homeschooling parents in the research phase.\n\nExploring why others have chosen this route is helpful, but the decision is ultimately unique to your children’s needs. Once you’re closer to making a decision, it’s best to step back and carefully consider your motivations one by one to determine if homeschooling is the solution. As a parent, you know best. If homeschooling is for you, you’ll know it!\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nHomeschooling: Helping Your Child With ASD Stay On Task\nHow to Homeschool an Athlete\nHave questions?

When it comes to keeping your child on task, it can be just as stressful for them as it is for you. However, there are things you can do to help them through this process, which in turn makes things easier for everyone.\n\nHere are five things you can do to help your learner with ASD stay on task:\n\n#1. Discover Their Optimal Learning Style\n\nEveryone has a learning style, or styles, in which they are able to acquire and retain the most information. For example, people can be visual (learning through sight), auditory (learning through hearing), or kinesthetic learners (learning through touch). Learners on the spectrum are no different, which is why finding the learning style most suited to your child can help you keep them on task during educational lessons.\n\nIf you find that you’re constantly having to repeat words or commands to your learner, then they may not be an auditory learner. They, instead, may respond better if you show them a visual representation of the word/command to accompany the verbal.\n\nIf you’re struggling to figure out their optimal learning style, then it’s best to use all three. For example, if you are teaching your learner mathematical concepts, you would show them a visual representation of the numbers you are working with on paper, verbally describe the problem you are teaching them, and then have them practice the problem with physical objects.\n\n#2. Make Learning Fun\n\nMaking lessons fun is a great way to keep any learner on task. Figure out the types of activities that your learner loves to do. For example, if he or she likes to dance and you want to teach them grammar, then you could creatively come up with ways to incorporate the two.\n\nIf your learner enjoys playing games on the computer or tablet, then you could find apps or a website that will teach educational concepts through games. However, make sure this is not your main method of teaching, or it may become all they ever want to do. To avoid that, you could make these digital game lessons a reward for completing other normally structured lessons. \n\nAnother ideas is: instead of having them write out words or numbers in pencil, allow them to use their favorite colored pens or pencils to make writing more exciting. When you make learning fun for them, you will have less of a hard time getting them to start and stay with a task.\n\n#3. Eliminate Distractions\n\nIt’s very important to make sure that your learner is in an environment that is conducive to learning. If you know your learner has a sensitivity to loud noises, you should make sure to conduct your lessons in a quiet place and at a time of day when loud noises are uncommon. Make sure their favorite devices or games are out of sight and out of reach.\n\nIf you know your learner has a hard time focusing on work while eating, then have them eat before or after a lesson instead of during. This will also help reduce the amount of times you will have to redirect them.\n\n#4. Create Reward Systems\n\nRewards can be a great help with motivating your learner to stay on task. It is important that the reward you choose is strong enough to motivate, small enough that it can be reproduced continuously, and isolated as a reward they only receive for completing educational tasks. \n\nFor example, if your learner has a favorite game they like to play, then as a reward you could allow them 30 minutes of play time after they complete their work for the day.\n\nIf you find that you constantly have to remind your learner of their reward to return them to task, it might help to set up a progress chart to show them how many tasks they have to complete before they receive their reward. \n\nAfter they complete each task, mark it off on the progress chart so that they know how much more they have to do. Make sure the reward is also shown on the chart as an end goal.\n\nSometimes learners can lose interest in getting a particular reward, so they stop responding to and doing the work for the reward like they were previously. \n\nIf you find that a reward that has worked in the past is no longer working, then it may be time to change it. It may not have been enticing enough, or they may have developed greater interest in something else.\n\n#5. Give Them A Break\n\nWe all need breaks sometimes. When tasks get overwhelming or are challenging for us, a break can be a great way to help us recuperate and get back into things. When incorporating breaks into your learner’s lessons, you can take a couple different approaches. \n\nYou can allot a certain number of breaks with each task and allow them to request one when they need to, or you can follow a structure similar to: 30 minutes of work followed by a 5 minute break. \n\nYou could also use timers so that your learner knows when it’s time to take a break and when it's time to return to work, or you could use break cards so they know how many breaks they have.\n\nIt is also important to make sure that these breaks are not play time. They should not be receiving their rewards, watching TV, or playing their favorite games during breaks, or you may find it’s a struggle to return them to work. \n\nInstead, these breaks should focus on the senses and giving their mind a break. Doing jumping jacks or jumping on a mini indoor trampoline, using resistance bands, listening to calming music, bouncing on an exercise ball, using fidget devices, or performing yoga moves are all great ways for your child to spend their break time.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to get a strategy to work for your learner, don’t get discouraged. It is normal for learners on the spectrum to be resistant to change, especially when you’ve been doing things a certain way for so long. \n\nTo help, make sure that you are developing these strategies according to your learner’s individual needs and desires. Persistence, repetition, and commitment are key in the beginning. Eventually, your learner should to adjust to the new way of doing things.\n\nHave more tips on homeschooling a child with ASD?

    "url": "https://247teach.org/blog/2018/9/19/instances-project-based-learning",
    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENSFOR ADULTSFOR ORGANIZATIONSNEWS & FREE RESOURCESABOUT US\n7 Instances of Project Based Learning in Everyday Life\n\nHere at 24/7, we know the value of Project Based Learning (PBL). It’s the heart of everything we do. As a result, we see PBL all around us. Even if you think you aren’t experienced with this method of learning, you are...because life is PBL. When you notice that life is made of projects, you begin to understand why PBL in a classroom or home setting is so valuable.\n\nBelow are seven ways we have found that PBL shows up in everyday life.\n\nAthletic endeavors. You don’t necessarily have to be training for a marathon for an athletic pursuit to count as Project Based Learning. Any time you lace up your shoes or grab a tennis racket, you’re going through the steps of any solid project: you have to plan, set a goal, implement, and evaluate. \n\nTeam sports are an especially great example of PBL, since you’re working with others to achieve a result, such as winning a game or making it to the championship. Whether you’re just out for a jog or competing in the Olympics, sports require many of the same skills you would use in a classroom project.\n\n\nPlay. When you watch children on a playground, you’ll realize that we all start out as project based learners. Before we grow up and forget, we know the importance of dreaming, building, discussing, and testing an idea. \n\nEvery fort, sandcastle, and imaginary battle is an act of PBL. Next time you observe young children, take note of the underlying structure of their play. This is how kids learn the way the world works.\n\n\nPlanning a trip. Starting with research and culminating in a full-blown itinerary, trip planning is a real-world project full of epic lessons. A vacation or work trip, especially an international one, requires attention to detail. \n\nPredicting potential obstacles and coming up with hypothetical solutions gives you plenty of advanced forecasting practice. This can be one of the most challenging and rewarding kinds of projects we encounter outside of school.\n\n\nParenting. You could say that parenting is the ultimate project. Raising little humans is a job full of challenges and triumphs, some that we get to prepare for and others that just appear unexpectedly. \n\nManaging a household, helping with homework, dealing with illnesses, and arranging schedules: PBL. It’s important to be driven, prepared, and reflective as a parent, all solid qualities we develop and apply in the parenting classroom.\n\n\nManual tasks. Chances are you have been tasked with the flat pack furniture puzzle at some point in your life. This is as PBL as it gets! You are given the tools you need and the instructions required and it is up to your interpretive and manual skills to complete the project.\n\nBuilding furniture. forces you to utilize your problem solving skills by visualizing what the finished product will look like and how you can use the tools provided to get to that stage. It’s basically the adult version of Lego, and who doesn’t love Lego\n\n\nCooking. You eat every single day, and chances are that you prepare and cook at least one of these meals. By nature, cooking is a fantastic version of PBL. With the key ingredients and instructions, you have the ability to turn something basic into something amazing. \n\nVariables such as portion control and time management are fantastic learning opportunities in both math and timekeeping, which can be transferred to various other projects that you will meet throughout life. Baking and cooking are equally aligned examples of PBL in real life that are not only great for children, but adults too.\n\n\nInterior design. Blank walls and an empty room just beg for a project to arise. Any time you are decorating a room or designing a new space, you’re engaging in PBL. \n\nWorking one layer at a time, you combine elements and try out unique pieces until you achieve the look you want. Even though it may not be as systematic as other everyday PBL moments, any form of art certainly encompasses the essential phases of a project.\n\nIf regular moments are made up of the principles of PBL, why shouldn’t we keep up that natural magic in the classroom? Our curriculum is centered around PBL because we want you to continue learning the way you were born to learn. \n\nWhat’s your favorite example of PBL in daily life?

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENSFOR ADULTSFOR ORGANIZATIONSNEWS & FREE RESOURCESABOUT US\nProject Profile: The Green City Movement\n\nGlobally, we are experiencing a paradigm shift, whether or not it seems evident in America at this time.  \n\nTrue visionaries see cities and communities shifting from carbon-based energy resources to renewable energy. Urban areas are transforming into more eco-friendly environments: becoming walkable cities with net-zero energy buildings, for example.  \n\nThese are not just empty visions, but rather part of a movement relating to the establishment of “green cities” that deliberately plan for the reduction or elimination of toxic air pollutants that have contributed to climate change.  \n\nEarth Talk defined the movement as:\n\n“... a loose association of cities focused on sustainability, the emerging \"green cities movement\" encompasses thousands of urban areas around the world all striving to lessen their environmental impacts by reducing waste, expanding recycling, lowering emissions, increasing housing density while expanding open space, and encouraging the development of sustainable local businesses.”\n\nGreen City Project Based Learning\n\nAs the Instructional Design & Delivery Director here at 24/7, I have designed a Project Based Learning (PBL) course for high school students around the concept of a green city. By way of research, planning, and engineering, students encapsulate the elements of an eco-city in a 3-D green city model.  \n\nThis is not a new project idea, but an updated, robust, and progressive version, which includes:\n\nexploring the chemistry of the atmosphere and air pollution, \n\nresearching net-zero energy buildings that are being erected in cities around the world, and\n\nincorporating the physics of photovoltaic systems and other green energy technology, such as wind and solar farms.  \n\nNot only do students research the science, but they also build miniature models of renewable energy that they will use to power their green city model. We even use some video game technology, such as Minecraft and simulations, which allow them to visualize a futuristic city that exemplifies healthy urban development. The project also requires learners to consider the physics of electrical currents and grid systems.  \n\nThis is an interactive and hands-on experience that provides real-life lessons in chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering. More importantly, learners get to approach a real-world problem and contribute to the green city movement in their own way.\n\nThis project is just one example of how Project Based Learning contributes to global ingenuity and allows students to become problem solvers. PBL is the future of education!\n\nWould you like to try out a FREE PBL lesson using our online platform?

It means we take the time to think about what we want to say, why we want to say it, how we want to say it, and how to successfully communicate it. \n\nRead More\nNEWEROLDER\nHave questions?

However, there are some things you can do as a homeschool parent to improve your learner’s focus with school-related tasks.\n\nBelow are our top three tips for better concentration:\n\nEliminate the Risk of Distraction During Lessons\n\nOne way to increase your learner’s focus is to eliminate any distractions within their learning space. If you notice your child tends to look out the window a lot when working, try drawing the shades. Keep them away from high-traffic areas, such as the front door of your house, so they don’t get distracted by someone coming home while they’re working. Also, make sure loose items are out of reach to minimize fidgeting. Even pencils can be a problem for distracted kids. Only make pencils visible and accessible it’s time to use them. \n\nSome other ideas for eliminating distractions and interruptions during lessons: turn your phone on vibrate or lower the ringer volume, making sure your learner is well fed before a lesson, and allow them to dress in comfortable attire.\n\nLearners who struggle with concentration aren’t just distracted by the outside world. They can also be distracted by their own thoughts and end up daydreaming. To help with this, try using regular check-ins to see if they’re paying attention, breaking tasks and lessons up into shorter periods of time, and playing music that is made to help with focus during assignments. Try teaching your learner some self-monitoring techniques so that they can recognize when they are getting distracted and get themselves back on task.\n\nUse Engaging Activities \n\nMaking learning exciting is easier said than done, depending on your child’s age and attitude towards school. If you can succeed at this, though, you can drastically minimize your learner’s lack of concentration. \n\nFirst, try using varying teaching methods for the same subjects. For example, if you normally use flash cards for vocabulary words, try using a vocabulary matching game or crossword puzzle instead. Then, change it up again for the following lesson. Incorporate surprises, mystery, humor, and events or topics that interest your learner.\n\nFor children who have trouble sitting still, building movement into lessons can also help. You can have your learner tap out the syllables to words, underline reading with colored pencils, take notes when you’re talking, draw pictures to illustrate vocabulary words, or use physical objects during math lessons to represent problems.\n\nMaster Motivating Your Child\n\nCreating different avenues of motivation can help your learner be more inspired to improve their concentration on their own. One way to create that motivation is by building a sense of urgency. If your learner is asking to go outside and play but they have one worksheet to complete, motivate them to complete their work by giving them a set time when they can be done. When they can see how close the reward is, they are more likely to stay on task and get it done.\n\nGive verbal praise when you notice your child trying to stay focused. Recognize their hard work by giving them extra time with their favorite activities outside of school commitments. Present them with homemade vouchers they can use to pick things they love, such as where the family goes for dinner or what to do on vacation some time in the near future.\n\nPositive reinforcement equips your learner with the ability to keep themselves on task and contributes to their own intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, motivation.\n\n\n\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nReducing Test Anxiety with the Three Principles\nProject Profile: The Green City Movement\nHave questions?

Click below:\nChatGPT Lesson 1\n \nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\nAs you complete this lesson, I want you to imagine that you are an instructional designer at a top e-learning company. You are tasked with designing a comprehensive e-learning course on customer service skills for a large retail chain. You are confident that you can deliver the project on time.\n\nHowever, one week into the project, the retail chain reaches out to you to explain that, due to unexpected events, they need the course completed in half of the time to roll out the training to their employees as soon as possible.\n\nYou understand the urgency of the situation and the importance of the training for the retail chain. But you have never created a course of this size, this quickly before. You’ve heard about how ChatGPT can help instructional designers save time in developing courses. After a little research, you reach out to 24/7 Teach to get a crash course on how to generate course content quickly using ChatGPT without compromising the quality of the learning experience.\n\n\n\nYour Objective:\n\nBy the end of this lesson you should be able to do the following: \n\nExplain the concept of ChatGPT and how it can be used to enhance instructional design. \n\nList the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT in instructional design.   \n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading:\n\nIn order to be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat is ChatGPT?\n\nWhy use ChatGPT in Instructional Design? \n\nWhat are the benefits of ChatGPT?\n\nWhat are the limitations of ChatGPT?\n\nLesson 1: \n1.1 What is ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT is an artificial intelligence program developed by OpenAI that has transformed the field of instructional design. Think of it as talking to a knowledgeable robot that can hold a conversation. This revolutionary tool imitates human-like conversation by using natural language processing to generate responses to questions posed to it. ChatGPT's machine learning algorithm is trained on vast amounts of data, including books, articles, and web pages, giving it a broad knowledge base to respond to a wide range of questions. In other words, ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating content quickly and efficiently for instructional designers.\n\n1.2 Why Do Instructional Designers Need ChatGPT?\n\nAs the field of instructional design evolves, instructional designers can benefit from using ChatGPT to enhance their ability to create effective and engaging learning experiences for their learners. As the field of instructional design evolves, emerging technologies such as ChatGPT can provide personalized and interactive learning content, making the instructional design process more efficient and effective. ChatGPT can assist in generating ideas and content for a course, providing quick feedback, and responding to learners' questions. \n\nWithout learning how to utilize ChatGPT, instructional designers risk being left behind in the industry as new tools and technologies emerge, making their skills less competitive. They may also be less efficient and effective in creating learning experiences, which could lead to decreased demand for their services. By knowing how to use ChatGPT, instructional designers can increase learner engagement and success, as well as enhance their ability to create high-quality learning experiences in record time.\n\n1.3 Benefits for Instructional Designers\n\nFor instructional designers, ChatGPT provides numerous benefits.

As a result, instructional designers must do their research prior to generating content in order to quickly spot inaccuracies. Instructional designers must also carefully review and fine-tune the output to ensure accuracy. \n\nLimited content expertise: ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to the topics covered in its training data. Therefore, it may not have the domain expertise required for specialized, obscure, or technical subjects. As a result,  instructional designers still need  to have background knowledge or expertise on the topics. \n\nLack of creativity: ChatGPT can generate responses based on patterns in its training data, but it cannot generate truly creative or innovative ideas that require human intuition and imagination.\n\nLack of emotional intelligence: ChatGPT is not capable of understanding human emotions or empathy. Therefore, it cannot establish or substitute personal connections with learners.\n\n1.5 Conclusion\n\nOverall, ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool for instructional designers. By understanding what it is and how it works and what its benefits and limitations are, designers can take advantage of its capabilities to create more effective and engaging learning experiences for their learners.\n\n1.6 Workshop Project\n\nAt the end of this workshop, you will complete a project in which you will create prompt templates for ChatGPT to generate content for a lesson, including learning objectives, a real-world scenario, an introduction, lesson content, and assessment questions.

Last year, I spent hours creating supplemental lessons for our reading lessons provided by our district, and using ChatGPT would have helped me become more efficient in my time and energy spent creating content.\n\nSince courses and lessons require a vast amount of knowledge, I think ChatGPT will benefit me in creating content that can be well-rounded when I don't know a lot about the given topic. I will want to fact check since ChatGPT can make mistakes, but I think that this could serve as a benefit.\n\nPreview POST REPLY\nPaul Pearson 3 months ago · 0 Likes\n  \n\nBeing a teacher, I encounter situations all of the time in which ChatGPT could be helpful to me. When developing lesson plans, sometimes I struggle to differentiate instruction to reach and challenge each learner. I also struggle to engage their learning from the start of the lesson. Using ChatGPT will help me enhance my lesson plans to reach every learner.\n\nWhen I design instruction, there's part of me that takes pride in learning content well enough to teach it, and to put it together in such a way that a learner finds it interesting as well. Initially when considering using ChatGPT for instructional purposes, it feels less personal for me, and it takes away from the fun of creating the entire lesson, but who has the time to create an entire lesson from the ground up every time with inclusive language, learning simulations, adaptive learning, and quality checks. Can it be done? Yes, but if I can use ChatGPT to help me, why wouldn't I if it will save me time and effort?\n\nPreview POST REPLY\nLesson 2 - Creating Objectives with ChatGPT\nHave questions?

Although this is a problem many students face, it is one in which a solution is unclear. Testing anxiety stems from issues such as lack of confidence in the material or stress on achieving a good grade. However, this can be combated with the help of three principles.\n\nThe formal definition for testing anxiety, according to Very Well Mind, is a “psychological condition in which people experience extreme distress and anxiety in testing situations.” This anxiety can go on to impair learning and hurt test performance. \n\nAs one who has experienced test anxiety on major exams like the SAT and Advanced Placement, I know firsthand what it feels like. If I were to instill confidence in my abilities using the three principles in this article, I could have succeeded in performing better and earning a higher grade.\n\nThere are steps that can be taken in order for students to perform better and reduce testing anxiety. For example, 24/7 Teach utilizes three principles that can aim to greatly reduce or even eliminate testing anxiety. By better understanding what these principles mean, parents can help their young learners take active approaches to enhance their testing abilities and reduce stress.\n\nPrinciple #1: Scores represent a learner’s position on a map at that moment in time, not their abilities.\n\nThis principle shows the student as one who progresses through a course as they learn new skills. Rather than treating the student as stationary, this map uses scores to gauge their knowledge and where they stand with a certain concept.\n\nWith this model, a score does not reflect a learner’s abilities. They are representative and reflect multiple areas of skills that a student develops.\n\nEducators use assessments and assessment scores to determine the student’s performance and can communicate how the student is doing. By doing so, educators can better tailor their lessons to the student and provide valuable feedback to get the student on the right track.\n\nThis principle can greatly reduce or eliminate testing anxiety by ensuring a student knows where they stand in their course. They can then practice the necessary skills that will be tested on exams. This is valuable to ensure that the correct material is being studied.\n\nParents can take this principle into account by checking in with their children and seeing their progress. If there are certain skills that need to be reinforced, as seen by placement on the map, parents can review these with their children. This will give students an extra amount of support and increase their performance on tests.\n\nPrinciple #2: Scores, like positions, change with determination, effort, guidance, practice and time. \n\nWith this principle, educators help students create reachable goals that can measure their position on the map. These goals can only be achieved by practicing the “growth mindset.” This explains two concepts: one, students must understand their ability to develop the desired outcomes and two, different levels of effort are required to achieve these outcomes.\n\nA student needs to understand where they are performing at the current position on the map, what level is expected, and how they are going to reach their desired outcomes. Once a student identifies these factors, they can grow in their learning and better achieve their desired outcomes. \n\nAs the principle explicitly states, scores change with determination, effort, guidance, practice and time. Educators should consider a student’s score and how they achieved it. Also, students should reflect on their scores to consider the factors listed. \n\nFurthermore, parents can help their children by reviewing concepts with them that were unclear or need more work. They can also instill feelings of motivation and provide feedback that will ensure their child is on the right track.\n\nWhen experiencing my own testing anxiety, I knew that I had to push forward and motivate myself to keep going. Feedback truly does wonders on one’s motivation.\n\nThis principle can help in greatly reducing or eliminating testing anxiety because students can learn to push forward and master the concepts they are not clear about. This will, in turn, boost their confidence and help them perform better on exams.\n\nSince testing anxiety is psychological, adopting a positive mindset that will allow a student to grow is crucial. It truly is all in your head.\n\nPrinciple #3: Everybody develops different skills with different levels of effort at different times.\n\nThis principle is important to understand because it shows that a student’s progression through a course is indeed that: progress. Students work through concepts in different ways and at different speeds.\n\nGoing back to the hypothetical map, students travel from place to place on the map as their assessment scores improve. The journey around the map can be achieved through practice of a skill. In other words, after the student learns a new skill, they must practice it to then move on to another skill.\n\nThere are two factors to look at when determining whether to move to the next position on the map: ability and effort. Ability is achieved when the skill can be replicated correctly over a period of time so that it becomes a habit. Effort is shown when a students practices a skill again and again in order to understand it.\n\nHowever, there is a risk when it comes to practicing. Students must be practicing the skill correctly. This means that if they repeatedly do a problem and get it wrong each time, the student is not doing it correctly. \n\nEducators can help fix this with guidance and feedback. By showing the student the right steps in solving the problem, it can ensure success.\n\nTesting anxiety can be greatly reduced or eliminated\n\n\nTesting anxiety can be greatly reduced or eliminated with this principle by showing students that practice makes perfect. They are not expected to perfect every skill but can make strides to do their best and ensure they understand a concept.\n\nWith these three principles in mind, both students and parents should put them into practice. After all, we have covered the reasons on why practice is important.\n\nBegin thinking as an entrepreneur. Constantly analyze what is effective or not, what drives a learner to stay motivated, and what factors will allow the educator or parent to measure results. How can you make the most out of these principles in order to reduce test-taking anxiety?\n\nHave your children think about what is important to them and why they wish to reduce test anxiety. Is it to focus more on the test and get a better grade? Is it to challenge themselves and see more improved results in their test-taking abilities?\n\nWhatever the reason, students must understand their mission and stick to it. As they produce new study habits or re-learn certain concepts, they will continually recall this mission and strive to do better than before. This essentially allows the student to focus their thoughts, just as an entrepreneur would.\n\nThrough this mindset, students will also find out what methods work and do not work. If they find one way that does not reduce test anxiety, they can figure out another way. The mind is continually at work, so it is best to utilize this whenever possible.\n\nThe three principles provide a core foundation for learning. 24/7 Teach uses these to develop material and coursework that benefits the student long-term. Students can acquire skills, known as transferable skills, that can be applied to other areas of life. \n\nFor example, easing test anxiety now can help in reducing more serious signs of anxiety in the future. Walking a student through the process of acceptance and learning can greatly benefit them.\n\n\nMy Conclusions\n\nOverall, by explaining that learning is a process through which determination and innovation will garner success, students can prosper in their academics and in their personal lives. They will acquire skills that can be applied to a variety of disciplines. They will also stand out to employers by displaying their newfound skills.\n\nThe three principles offer guidance to explain how testing anxiety can be reduced or eliminated. Students can now utilize these to alter their study habits and become more efficient learners.\n\nIf there are problems to be solved, there will be solutions. If there are roadblocks in learning, there will be ways to overcome them. \n\nNow, it seems as if test anxiety just got a whole lot easier to manage.\n\nDon't forget to share this post!\n\nKnow someone experiencing testing anxiety? \nCheck out our Teen Seminar:\nQUICK VIEW\nOvercoming Testing Anxiety for Teens\nfrom $295.95\nSeminar Options and Duration::\nSelect Seminar Options and Duration:\nSelf-Paced - Learn and Work at your own pace\n3-Week intensive - includes One on One Mentorship and Community Project\n8 Week Immersive - includes One on One Mentorship, Community Project, and Mastermind Study\nREGISTER TODAY\n It could change someone’s life.\nGet the latest 24/7 News\n\nSubscribe with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nHomeschooling for Beginners, a Start-Up Guide from a Student's point of View\nHomeschooling: 3 Tips For Better Concentration With ADHD\nHave questions?

AI can offer new and innovative ways to enhance the learning experience for students, and instructional designers are uniquely positioned to leverage these tools to create more effective and engaging learning experiences. Now that you have learned all about Chat GPT, in this lesson, we will explore AI tools that instructional designers can use to enhance their skills. We will discuss how these tools work, their potential benefits, and ways they can be integrated into the instructional design process.\n\n6.2 AI-Powered Learning Platforms\n\nAs AI technology continues to transform the field of education, there are a growing number of AI-powered platforms available to enhance learning outcomes. Two such platforms are Knewton Alta and ALEKS. If you are an instructional designer looking to incorporate AI learning tools into creating instructional materials, it's essential to understand the features and benefits of each platform. Let's learn about these two platforms and explore their similarities and differences to help you determine which one may be the best fit for your needs.\n\nKnewton Alta and ALEKS are both AI-powered learning platforms. Knewton Alta uses AI technology to provide personalized recommendations, assessments, and feedback to students, while ALEKS uses adaptive assessments and personalized learning paths based on student performance data to guide student learning. Both platforms leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and adjust course materials and recommendations in real-time to optimize learning outcomes.\n\nOne significant difference is in their focus. Knewton Alta is designed primarily to support higher education courses in STEM fields, whereas ALEKS is more broadly focused on K-12 and college-level courses in a range of subjects, including math, science, and business.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Knewton Alta and ALEKS will depend on the specific needs and goals of the instructional designer or institution. Knewton Alta may be a better fit for those looking for a comprehensive, interactive textbook solution with adaptive learning features in STEM fields, while ALEKS may be better suited for those looking for a more focused adaptive assessment and personalized learning path solution in a variety of subjects.\n\n6.3  AI Tools for Visual Design and ELearning\n\nTome is a cutting-edge AI-powered tool that helps instructional designers create engaging and effective learning content quickly and easily. By leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), Tome enables instructional designers to streamline their content creation processes and develop personalized learning experiences that cater to the needs of individual learners.\n\nHere's how Tome works: first, you input the key learning objectives for your content, along with any relevant keywords or phrases that you want to include. Then, using its advanced NLP algorithms, Tome scours the internet to find relevant content and sources that match your criteria. It analyzes the information it gathers and organizes it into a structured, easy-to-follow outline that you can use as the basis for your learning content.\n\nBut that's not all - Tome also has a powerful built-in text generation engine that can help you create high-quality, customized content quickly and easily. You can use this feature to write summaries, explanations, examples, and other types of content that align with your learning objectives and resonate with your audience.\n\nTome can also help create presentations for instructional designers. While the primary focus of Tome is on generating written content, it can also assist with creating slide decks and other visual aids for presentations.\n\nTo create a presentation with Tome, you can use the tool to generate the written content for your slides. You can then copy and paste this content into your presentation software, such as PowerPoint or Google Slides, and use it as the basis for your slides.\n\nAdditionally, you can use DALL-E 2, which is another AI-powered tool from OpenAI that generates images from textual descriptions DALL-E 2 works seamlessly with Tome, to generate images that you can include in your presentation slides. This can help you create highly immersive and engaging learning content that captures your learners' attention and helps them retain information more effectively.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using Tome in instructional design is that it helps you create highly personalized learning experiences. By analyzing your learners' preferences and using AI to generate content that meets their individual needs, Tome ensures that each learner receives a tailored learning experience that maximizes their engagement and retention. While supporting instructional design by creating quick and easy learning content.\n\n6.4  AI Authoring Platform\n\nSmart Sparrow is an adaptive learning platform that allows instructional designers to create and deliver interactive and personalized learning experiences for their students. This platform is designed to provide a unique and effective approach to online teaching and learning by enabling educators to tailor content and assessments to the individual needs and preferences of each student.\n\nSmart Sparrow works by providing a cloud-based authoring platform where instructional designers can create and publish their own digital content, such as simulations, games, quizzes, and interactive lessons. The platform also includes an analytics engine that tracks student progress and performance, allowing educators to adjust their teaching strategies based on real-time data.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Smart Sparrow is its ability to personalize learning experiences for each student. The platform uses adaptive algorithms to adjust the difficulty level of content and assessments based on the student's individual progress and knowledge level. This means that students can work at their own pace and receive feedback that is tailored to their needs.\n\nAnother advantage of Smart Sparrow is its flexibility. The platform is compatible with a wide range of learning management systems (LMS) and can be integrated with other educational tools and resources.

Click below:\nChatGPT Lesson 3\n \nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\n \n\nAs you complete this course, I want you to imagine that you are an instructional designer at a top e-learning company. You are tasked with designing a comprehensive e-learning course on customer service skills for a large retail chain. You are confident that you can deliver the project on time.\n\nHowever, one week into the project, the retail chain reaches out to you to explain that, due to unexpected events, they need the course completed in half of the time to roll out the training to their employees as soon as possible.\n\nYou understand the urgency of the situation and the importance of the training for the retail chain. But you have never created a course of this size, this quickly before. As you have progressed through the 24/7 Teach workshop, you have developed effective ChatGPT prompts that helped you develop effective learning objectives in record time. Your next step is to create effective prompts that generate lesson introductions and scenarios that motivate your learners to engage in your course. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nBy the end of this lesson you should be able to do the following: \n\nUnderstand the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality lesson introductions and scenarios, including clarity, relevance, and creativity.\n\nApply strategies to improve ChatGPT prompts and generate quality lesson introductions and scenarios that align with specific learning objectives.\n\nEvaluate the quality of ChatGPT prompts and the resulting lesson introductions and scenarios, and self-assess if additional prompting or adjustments to the ChatGPT results are necessary to make iterative improvements.\n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading:\n\nIn order to be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat are the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts?\n\nEvaluate the quality of ChatGPT prompts and the resulting lesson introductions and scenarios\n\nLesson 3: \n3.1   The Importance of Introductions and Scenarios\n\nWhen designing an effective lesson, a good introduction and a real-world scenario can establish engagement, context, and relevance for the learner, which is important because they help to capture the learner’s attention and interest in the topic.  Learners who are engaged and interested in the lesson content are more likely to be motivated to learn and  retain the information presented.\n\nContextualizing the lesson content and relating it to real-world scenarios can help learners see the practical applications of what they are learning and how it can be useful. This also helps learners connect new information to their prior knowledge, making it easier to understand and remember.\n\nAdditionally, establishing relevance helps learners understand why the topic is important and how it relates to their personal and professional goals. This can help learners stay motivated and engaged throughout the lesson, leading to more successful learning outcomes.\n\nBy incorporating these tools, instructional designers can develop lessons that promote higher-order thinking and advances the learners' thinking. Learners can connect the lesson content to their personal experiences, engage in additional dialogue, and develop a deeper understanding of the topic being covered.\n\n3.2   Essentials of Effective Introductions and Scenarios\n\nGood introductions should have the following key essentials:\n\nAttention: Grabs the learner's attention\n\nRelevance: Establishes the relevance of the lesson to the learner\n\nContext: Provides any necessary background information to help the learner understand the lesson\n\nGood real-world scenarios should have the following key essentials:\n\nPersonal: Relates to the learner's personal experiences or interests\n\nRelevant and Realistic: Provides a relevant and realistic context for the lesson content\n\nPractical: Demonstrates the practical application of the lesson content in a real-world situation\n\nValue: Allows the learner to see the value and importance of the lesson content\n\n3.3   Strategies to Prompt ChatGPT for Introductions and Scenarios\n\n3.3.1   Introductions\n\nTemplate: Here’s a sample prompt template to produce quality introductions:\n\nWrite an attention-grabbing introduction to a lesson about the importance/value of [lesson topic, audience, and context].\n\nFor example, instead of prompting ChatGPT to do the following:\n\nPrompt A. “Write an introduction to a lesson about dogs”\n\nYou can prompt ChatGPT with the following:\n\nPrompt B. “Write an attention-grabbing introduction to a lesson about the value of being knowledgeable about dogs for first-time dog buyers.”\n\n\n\nPro-Tip: The introduction generated from this prompt is often short. Follow up with a statement like: “Write a longer introduction.” You will be able to use part of both responses to create an engaging introduction. From personal experience, if you simply ask ChatGPT to write a long, engaging introduction, the results are not as good as using the template and the follow up. To improve the clarity and accuracy of ChatGPT's responses, instructional designers may need to provide additional prompts or information. \n\nAdditional prompts can: \n\na) provide context \n\nb) use specific language \n\nc) break down complex questions into smaller and more specific questions \n\nd) ask for examples\n\ne) ask follow up questions\n\nDirections: Think about how Prompt B can better help ChatGPT generate an introduction that 1) grabs the learner’s attention, 2) is relevant to the target audience, 3) provides necessary context for the learner\n\nClick here to compare your conclusions\n\n3.3.2   Scenarios\n\nTemplate: Now, here’s a sample prompt template to produce quality scenarios:\n\nWrite an engaging scenario using a real-world problem in which [audience] would need to apply knowledge and skills of [lesson].\n\nFor example, instead of prompting ChatGPT to do the following:\n\n“Write a scenario for a lesson about dogs”\n\nYou can prompt ChatGPT with the following:\n\n“Write an engaging scenario using a real-world problem in which first-time dog buyers would need to apply knowledge and skills of being knowledgeable about dogs.”\n\n3.4 Practice\n\nUsing the introduction prompt template below, rewrite Prompt A to create a better introduction prompt. Then compare your prompt with the prompt used for this lesson.\n\nIntroduction Prompt Template: Write an attention-grabbing introduction to a lesson about the importance/value of [lesson topic, audience, and context].\n\nPrompt A: Write an introduction to a lesson about introductions and scenarios.\n\nClick here to see what introduction prompts were used for this lesson\nClosing Assessment:\n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:\n\nUnderstand the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality lesson introductions and scenarios, including clarity, relevance, and creativity.\n\nApply strategies to improve ChatGPT prompts and generate quality lesson introductions and scenarios that align with specific learning objectives\n\nEvaluate the quality of ChatGPT prompts and the resulting lesson introductions and scenarios, and self-assess if additional prompting or adjustments to the ChatGPT results are necessary to make iterative improvements.\n\nAssessment Question:\n\nClick the tab below to respond to the following assessment question.\n\nExplain the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality introductions and scenarios for lessons.\n\nCOMPLETE LESSON ASSESSMENT\nDiscussion Question:\n\nConnect with the 24/7 Teach community by posting your discussion question responses in the comment section below.\n\nCan you think of a time when an AI system like ChatGPT could have been helpful in creating effective lesson objectives?

Click below:\nChatGPT Lesson 2\n \nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\nAs you complete this lesson, I want you to imagine that you are an instructional designer at a top e-learning company. You are tasked with designing a comprehensive e-learning course on customer service skills for a large retail chain. You are confident that you can deliver the project on time.\n\nHowever, one week into the project, the retail chain reaches out to you to explain that, due to unexpected events, they need the course completed in half of the time to roll out the training to their employees as soon as possible.\n\nYou understand the urgency of the situation and the importance of the training for the retail chain. But you have never created a course of this size, this quickly before. Fortunately, you have started the 24/7 Teach workshop and now you understand the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT to create a course. The next step in your design process is to develop appropriate ChatGPT prompts in order for you to develop effective learning objectives for your course.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following: \n\nUnderstand the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality learning objectives\n\nApply strategies to improve ChatGPT prompts to generate quality learning objectives. \n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading:\n\nIn order to be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat are characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality learning objectives?\n\nHow can I improve ChatGPT prompts to generate quality learning objectives? \n\nLesson 2: \n2.1 Importance of Lesson Objectives\n\nCreating objectives before creating a lesson is important for several reasons:\n\nProvides focus: Objectives help to focus the lesson on specific learning outcomes. This ensures that the lesson is designed to achieve specific learning goals and that all activities and assessments are aligned with those goals.\n\nHelps with assessment: Objectives provide a clear set of criteria for assessing whether students have achieved the desired learning outcomes. This helps instructors design assessments aligned with the objectives and provide meaningful feedback to students.\n\nIncreases motivation: Clear and specific objectives can motivate students by providing a clear sense of what they will learn and how they will benefit from the lesson.\n\nImproves communication: Objectives provide a common language for communication between instructors, students, and other stakeholders involved in the learning process. This can help to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the purpose and goals of the lesson.\n\nOverall, creating objectives before creating a lesson helps to ensure that the lesson is well-designed, effective, and aligned with the desired learning outcomes.\n\n2.2 Essentials of Lesson Objectives\n\nGood objectives should have the following key characteristics:\n\nSpecific: Objectives should be clear and precise, stating exactly what the learner will be able to know or do after completing the lesson.\n\nAppropriately Rigorous: Objectives should be appropriately challenging so that learners are engaging with the material at the appropriate level of cognitive complexity.\n\nMeasurable: Objectives should be measurable so that learners and instructors can determine whether or not the objective has been achieved.\n\n2.3 Strategies to Prompt ChatGPT for Lesson Objectives\n\nChatGPT can be an incredibly useful tool for instructional designers who need to create lesson objectives quickly and efficiently. However, as with any tool, it's important to use ChatGPT effectively to achieve the desired outcomes. Simply asking ChatGPT to generate lesson objectives without carefully considering the prompts provided can result in ineffective or inappropriate objectives that don't align with the learning outcomes. Therefore, instructional designers need to understand the principles of writing effective prompts that ChatGPT can use to generate high-quality objectives. Here are some strategies to consider when developing lesson objective prompts for ChatGPT:\n\nContext: Provide context about the audience and the lesson in your prompt\n\nBloom’s: Ask ChatGPT to include Bloom's verbs in the objective. Aligning objectives with Bloom's Taxonomy can help ensure your objectives have appropriate rigor and that your assessments help measure whether the learner has met the learning goal\n\nVariety: Consider including the number of objectives you are looking for in your prompt. This technique will ensure you have a variety of objectives to choose from, especially if you are planning to have multiple lessons\n\n2.4 Objectives Prompt Template\n\nHere’s a sample prompt template to produce quality lesson objectives:\n\nUsing Bloom’s verbs, write [number] of learning objectives for a [class type] for [audience] on [lesson topic] for/to [purpose].\n\nFor example, instead of prompting ChatGPT the following:\n\n “Create a lesson objective about dogs”\n\nYou can prompt ChatGPT with the following:\n\n“Using Blooms verbs, write 1 objective for a beginner-level class on animal behavior for pet owners to understand the different types of dogs and their behaviors.”\n\nPro-tip: If you are struggling to rewrite a prompt, you can ask ChatGPT to use the template above to rewrite your prompt using the following template:\n\nRewrite this objective (\"Create a lesson objective about dogs\") using the following template: Using Blooms verbs, write [number] of learning objectives for a [class type] for [audience] on [lesson topic] for/to [purpose].\n\n2.5 Practice\n\nTwo prompts, Prompt A and Prompt B, were given to ChatGPT, asking for learning objectives about a lesson on how to use ChatGPT. Look at some of the objectives that were provided in the sample ChatGPT responses below.\n\nDirections: As you review, think about which set of objectives would be easier to create assessment questions from.\n\nPrompt A:\n\nObjective 1: To introduce participants to the basics of using ChatGPT for educational purposes.\n\nObjective 2: To help participants understand the strengths and limitations of using ChatGPT for educational purposes.\n\nObjective 3: To provide participants with practical strategies for using ChatGPT to create effective lesson plans, including how to align prompts with learning objectives, incorporate multimedia elements, and evaluate results.\n\nPrompt B\n\nObjective 1: Define the concept of ChatGPT and explain how it can be used to enhance instructional design, including how to generate text, select prompts, and refine results. (Remembering)\n\nObjective 2: List the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT in instructional design, including how to ensure accuracy and engagement. (Understanding)\n\nObjective 3: Apply ChatGPT to design an effective and engaging learning experience that aligns with specific learning objectives. (Applying)\n\nDirections: Look at the Prompt A text below. Use the Objectives Prompt Template to rewrite Prompt A. Then compare your response with the Prompt B text in the dropdown. \n\nPrompt A: “Write objectives for a workshop on using ChatGPT to create effective lessons”\n\nObjectives Prompt Template: Using Bloom’s verbs, write [number] of learning objectives for a [class type] for [audience] on [lesson topic] for/to [purpose].\n\nClick here to compare your response with the Prompt B text\nGet a Head Start!\n\nTake this opportunity to experiment with learning objectives prompts for your project topic.\n\nClosing Assessment:\n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should know the following:\n\nThe characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality learning objectives\n\nHow to improve ChatGPT prompts to generate quality learning objectives  \n\n\nAssessment Questions:\n\nClick the tab below to respond to the following assessment questions.\n\nExplain the characteristics of effective ChatGPT prompts that generate quality learning objectives\n\nList a few strategies to improve ChatGPT prompts to generate quality learning objectives.\n\nCOMPLETE LESSON ASSESSMENT\nDiscussion Question:\n\nConnect with the 24/7 Teach community by posting your discussion question responses in the comment section below.\n\nCan you think of a time when an AI system like ChatGPT could have been helpful in creating effective lesson objectives?

Try a different browser.\n\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\n \n\nAs you complete this lesson, I want you to imagine that you are an instructional designer at a top e-learning company. You have been tasked with creating a comprehensive e-learning course on customer service skills for a large retail chain. One week into the project, the retail chain contacts you with an urgent request to complete the course in half the time due to unexpected events. While you are confident in your ability to deliver the project on time, you have never created a course of this size and complexity in such a short timeframe before.\n\nFortunately, you recently started a 24/7 Teach course on how to prompt ChatGPT. With the completion of the first two lessons in the course, you've gained the confidence to prompt ChatGPT to create learning objectives, lesson introductions, and scenarios. You are now ready to begin the next lesson that will teach you how to effectively prompt ChatGPT for creating lesson content, providing  you with the skills needed to develop a high-quality course content that meets the needs of the retail chain within the tight deadline.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nBy the end of this lesson you should be able to do the following: \n\n Explain how ChatGPT can be used to generate effective lesson content \n\nCreate effective lesson prompts for ChatGPT to generate quality lesson content \n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading:\n\nIn order to be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nHow can ChatGPT be used to generate effective lesson content?\n\nHow can you create effective lesson prompts for ChatGPT to generate quality lesson content?\n\n\nLesson 4: \n4.1 Strategies for Managing the Limitations of ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT can save instructional designers time and provide ideas for and generate lesson content. However, in order to use it effectively to create high-quality lesson content that aligns with learning objectives, instructional designers need strategies to manage ChatGPT’s limitations (like potential inaccuracies or incomplete responses).\n\nHere are some strategies to manage the limitations of ChatGPT when generating lesson content:\n\nResearch the topic beforehand: Designers should have a good understanding of the topic they want to teach before asking ChatGPT to generate lesson content. This way, they can more easily detect inaccuracies or errors in the responses.\n\nTailor prompts to audience and learning objectives: Designers should create prompts that are specific to their audience and learning objectives to ensure effective lesson design.\n\nProbe for more detail: If the response provided by ChatGPT is incomplete, designers should use probing questions to gather more information and detail that can be used to develop effective lesson content.\n\nReview and edit generated content: Designers should carefully review the content generated by ChatGPT and edit it as needed to improve not only accuracy but also the alignment of the lesson with the audience, learning objectives, and user experience. This could involve rephrasing content, adding additional information, or removing inaccurate information.\n\nProvide feedback: Designers can also provide feedback to ChatGPT by telling it that the information provided is inaccurate, which can help improve the model's accuracy over time. Designers can also input content with the correct information that ChatGPT can use as a basis for generating future content.\n\n4.2 Characteristics of Effective Prompts\n\nEffective prompts are critical to ensuring that ChatGPT generates quality instructional content. Here are some characteristics of effective prompts:\n\nClear and specific: Prompts should be clear and specific, providing ChatGPT with a clear understanding of what the instructional content should cover.\n\nRelevant and aligned with learning objectives: Prompts should be relevant and focused on the specific learning objectives that the instructional content is intended to achieve.\n\nKeywords: Prompts that use Blooms-related verbs like \"describe\" and \"explain,\" can help ensure that the instructional content is aligned with the learning objectives.\n\nWhile ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for instructional designers, it's important to understand its limitations and use it effectively to create high-quality lesson content. By following the strategies outlined in this lesson, designers can effectively manage the limitations of ChatGPT and create engaging and effective learning experiences that align with their learning objectives.\n\n4.3 Tips to Structure Lesson Prompts\n\nHere are a few steps to structure your lesson prompts:\n\n1.       Prompt for an outline. Ask ChatGPT to create an outline for your lesson using your learning objective(s). Include the learner/audience when necessary.\n\n2.       Restate outline topics. Prompt ChatGPT with each topic in your lesson outline. You can restate your outline topic in the form of a question or using blooms-aligned verbs like “explain” or “describe”. If you provide one outline topic at a time you will get more content. (Note: Don’t ask ChatGPT to write a lesson because it will often produce an outline instead. On the other hand, if you ask ChatGPT to write a blog post, this will generate a response in paragraph form with an informal tone.)\n\n3.       Probe ChatGPT further. Ask ChatGPT to elaborate or probe it with a question that connects to the audience. If there are details in the response that you want ChatGPT to generate more content on, use that information in your follow up prompts. Use prompt stems like, “Explain more about… ” or “What is…?” or “What is the difference between…?” or “Why is … important?”. If you want the generated content to be more relevant to your audience, you can prompt with stems like, “Why is [subtopic] important to [audience]?” or “How can [subtopic] help [audience]?” The more specific you are, the better the results from ChatGPT.\n\n4.4 Practice Creating a Prompt Template\n\nPractice 1\n\nNow practice creating lesson content prompts using the information about part of today’s lesson below.\n\nLesson Topic: Creating Lesson Content with ChatGPT\n\nAudience: Instructional designer\n\nLearning objectives:\n\nInstructional designers will be able to explain the limitations of ChatGPT and strategies to handle those limitations\n\nInstructional designers will apply strategies to create effective lesson content prompts\n\nLesson Outline Excerpt:\n\nExplain the limitations of ChatGPT in generating lesson content for instructional designers’ courses\n\nExplain strategies to handle the limitations of using ChatGPT to generate lesson content for their courses\n\nDirections: Use the lesson information above to create a lesson topic prompt.\n\nClick here to compare your lesson topic prompt with the ones used for today’s lesson:\n\nPractice 2\n\nDirections: Imagine that in ChatGPT’s response to your prompt, you notice that an important topic is not included.

Are you looking to homeschool, but don’t know where to begin? Have you answered yes to both of these questions?   \n\nIn this post, you will find reasons why parents choose to homeschool and discover the fundamentals of starting your own.\n\nHomeschooling is something I know very well, having been homeschooled until I graduated high school. I had many friends who were homeschooled for various reasons, and whose parents followed varying curriculums and teaching styles. After high school, I went into college prepared and ready for the future (well, as much as a college student can be). This post is written for those of you who are new to homeschooling, or are just curious about it, or maybe have barely started. Never fear; you are only a beginner before you have begun! \n\n1. UNDERSTAND YOUR GOALS:\n\nFirst, you need to ask yourself: what is you goal of homeschooling? More importantly, why do you, as a parent, need or want to homeschool? Are the public schools in your area not cutting it?  Does your child need individual or accelerated learning or have special needs? Are you tired of paying private school tuition?  Maybe your family needs something more flexible to meet a busy schedule. Whatever the reason, there is no such thing as a bad one. \n\nThe following is a list of reasons to why many families homeschool. You can view it as a sort of checklist, if you like: \n\nBetter environment (no more bullying, harmful influences, etc.) \n\nChildren with special needs (learning disabilities/physical needs, etc.) \n\nRegulate what your child learns and when (advanced curriculum, etc.) \n\nFlexibility (good for busy families or if you move quite a bit) \n\nThe freedom to instill religious values in your child’s education\n\nMy family homeschooled because they were concerned about the environment public schools offered students, especially bullying, and also because they wanted the freedom to practice our faith and teach it to us. If you agreed with even one of those reasons stated above, or maybe followed the link and found another reason, then you just might have found your goal for homeschooling. Finding your purpose for homeschooling is the first step in a long but fruitful process. If you do not know why you must do something, you will be unable to back up your opinion with evidence. \n\n2. SEIZE YOUR POWER: \n\nWhat is power and what does it have to do with homeschooling? Power, in this case, is an example of what homeschooling can give back to you. Now that you have chosen (or hopefully are choosing) a reason to homeschool, we must discover why it is an option in the first place. The reasons above are part of the equation; they are like the trunk of a tree. \n\nNow, we are going to look at the branches. Here is a brief list of reasons homeschooling gives students power: \n\n1. Students score better on standardized tests and the ACT/SAT. \n\n2. Students are more socially and emotionally healthy. \n\n3. Students have a stronger sense of identity and who they are. \n\n4. Students will thrive in college much more quickly, and better. \n\n5. Students are more likely to vote if they are homeschooled. \n\n6. Students are socially equipped and well-socialized in an organic way.\n\n3. DEVELOP YOUR STYLE: \n\nNow that we have established goals of homeschooling and why homeschooling gives students a powerful boost, let’s dive into the flexibility homeschooling has! This, as you probably remember, was also an incentive for homeschooling. The style of learning in homeschooling varies from family to family. It could be a classroom set-up in a special room of the house, or reading a textbook on the way to a museum. It could be an online math curriculum or studying whatever your child finds interesting—so long as they learn the basics. Whatever your style, remember to find what works for you based on what your child needs. \n\nI loved this part of school because I got to work at my own pace. Compared to public school, we finished the textbook in my house, which meant that I learned all of what I needed to and spent less time reviewing the next semester. Although my family used a more traditional textbook method, we also used online foreign language programs and counted an art museum as “art history”. A documentary counted as science, history, or anything else. This is especially good for students who need to work slower or faster. This taught me that life is always about learning, and learning never stops. \n\n\n4. KNOW THE LAWS AND YOUR RIGHTS\n\nNow that you have a basic idea of homeschooling itself (and trust me, there is a lot more I could tell you!), it is time to explore some ways you can get started as a beginner. \n\nFirst, make sure you check your state’s laws on homeschooling. Some states require very strict records and testing, while some might not care that much as long as your child learns what they need to know based your area’s requirements. It’s always good to stay informed about your area’s laws. If your family is moving to another country, check what that country requires as well. \n\nKeep in mind that not everyone you meet will know you homeschool, so it is a good idea to get involved with a legal organization, such as the Home School Legal Defense Association, HSLDA for the United States, in case you need emergency legal help. The most i had to deal with as a student was people asking random questions like “Do you like homeschooling?”. But it is always a good idea to be prepared. \n\n5. DEVELOP A  RECORD KEEPING A SYSTEM\n\nRecords are your number one way to make sure your child is on track and getting the information they need. These could be a transcript, or just a list of subjects covered and tests. Transcripts are required for high school, but for younger grades they are not always required.\n\nMy family kept track of our hours, which really just means “how long we did a subject that day”. If I did thirty minutes of science, I wrote down the subject and the timeframe. In high school, grades were placed on my transcript, while in grade school, I just did the work and learned more from experience than a grade. Check with your area to see the requirements to graduate, because the number of courses or hours determines how you structure courses, especially in high school. \n\nCheck out 24/7 Learning Academies’ Free Record Keeping Resources\n\n6. THINK ABOUT SOCIALIZATION \n\nThis is such a misunderstood part of homeschooling it is laughable: homeschoolers are, yes, socialized! Are you concerned about how to do that? It is easier than you might think. Find a group of homeschoolers you can speak to. They can help you find new ways to homeschool, create more socialization for your child, and give you, the parent, a way to have fun as well! \n\nOften you can find Facebook groups of moms or parents chatting about ideas and funny moments. Trips can also be included in a nontraditional curriculum as well. This could include going to an art museum or doing cheer practice. We homeschoolers also have something called a “co-op”, which is ingrained in the homeschooling culture. This is a group of homeschoolers who gets together on a certain day of the week; parents teach a certain subject to give kids an idea of a classroom setting, but the subjects can range \n\n\n7.  CHOOSE YOUR CURRICULUM \n\nCurriculum varies from family to family. It might be the usual textbook-and-lecture, an online curriculum, a form of unschooling, or a mixture of all three. The best thing to do is to try and try again! Often, these things will be discovered by using one method after another until you find a system that works for you. One of the best memories I have of finding a curriculum when I was homeschooled is begging my mom for a specific science book, because I loved the images and vocabulary. \n\nSpoiler: I finally got it in sixth grade! My point is that you can tailor curriculum not only for the family’s needs but also for what your child needs, no matter how they learn. I suggest Google-ing or researching different curriculum companies that fit your needs. \n\nNOW TO WRAP UP… \n\nHomeschooling is not for everyone. That is completely okay. The goal is to become educated about new ideas for schooling if the traditional way is not working for you. Homeschooling can be done for many reasons, and creates a power that families do not usually have in public schools. It also gives students power over their own education and future, and creates confidence. As a plus side, homeschooling can be altered to fit your personal needs! Some ways to get started are: to research your state’s requirements; find a way to keep records that works; seek out other homeschoolers and opportunities to “do stuff”; and choose a curriculum suited to your needs. \n\nRemember: there is no wrong way to learn. If you do choose to homeschool, then I challenge you. Do some legwork, do some soul-searching, and the make a choice.

I promise, you will not regret it. \n\nDon't forget to share this post and comment below!\n\nAre you looking to start homeschooling but don’t know where to begin?\nCheck out our Parent Workshop:\nQUICK VIEW\nHow to Start or Improve your Homeschool - Parent Workshop\n$495.95\nREGISTER TODAY\nStart Homeschooling with Confidence\nGet the latest 24/7 News\n\nSubscribe with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nTeen Social Skills 101: A Guide to Surviving the Most Awkward Time of Your Life\nReducing Test Anxiety with the Three Principles\nHave questions?

Starting a business as a teenager can significantly support your personal and professional development, financial independence, pathway to college and set you on the path to having the career of your dreams.  \n\nBefore diving head-first into your entrepreneurship journey, it must be noted that, while being young may provide you with endless energy and fresh perspectives in the business world, it’s not always an easy and glamorous path to take. While networking, you may come across older professionals who doubt the credibility and sustainability of your business. And without hands-on experience, you will undoubtedly confront complex problems for the very first time, and often without any ideas on how to solve them.\n\nNevertheless, with an abundance of information available on the internet and various ways to meet potential mentors, you can always find solutions to the most challenging problems. However, the challenge in most cases is not just knowing the answer but executing the solution.  \n\nWith the right resources, work ethic, and tenacity, you can get a head start and be far ahead of your peers. If you’re looking to start now, you have come to the right place. Stick around and learn the top 10 reasons why you, as a teenager, should start your business today!\n\n10 Reasons to Learn Entrepreneurship\n1. Future-Proof Yourself - The world is changing:\n\nThe future of the job economy is ambiguous and in flux. \n\nIt’s difficult to predict what types of occupations will be available when a teen is grown and ready to enter the job market. While companies are scrambling to meet the demands of an upsurge in the population of new young workers, it’s critical for you to future-proof yourself with entrepreneurial skills. Not only can entrepreneurs create jobs, but they also have access to an inventory of skills that will help them navigate their career paths. \n\n2. Monetize Your Hobbies:\n\nThere’s one thing in life that we’re never able to reacquire once it’s gone. It’s not money nor material items. It’s time. \n\nTime, when utilized correctly, contains the ingredients to success, happiness, growth, and prosperity. But at the same time, if neglected, it will leave us with very little.  By learning entrepreneurship, one can build life-long habits like working smart, setting goals, and planning strategies to maximize time. What if getting up an hour earlier on a summer day could earn you some extra spending money? What if those hours of playing video games could be exchanged with creating something you could monetize? What if you could do the things you enjoy day-in, day-out while being profitable?\n\nEntrepreneurship shifts your mindset on the concept of time and allows you to transform your passion into something meaningful.\n\n3. Master Finance Management:\n\nWhether it be a successful athlete, lottery winner, or entrepreneur, you can lose it all within a few years by immaturely blowing away your money. \n\nIt is therefore important to learn the ways to effectively manage money at a young age. And no, topping one’s piggy bank with spare change does not teach kids how to manage money. However, and as you may expect, entrepreneurship does. From learning how to increase revenues and lower expenses to tracking purchases and planning monthly budgets, entrepreneurship can teach teenagers life skills that will be applicable throughout their everyday life, as well as within the business world.\n\n\n4. Adopt an Entrepreneurial Mindset :\n\nRegardless of whether you work for yourself and start a business, or work for an employer, a strong set of entrepreneurial mindsets is critical for success in our rapidly changing world. \n\nAs the founder of Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford, put it, “whether you think you can or you think you can’t - you’re right”. Anyone can develop the mindset of a successful entrepreneur. And not only can an entrepreneurial mindset be nurtured, but it is also important to start young. \n\nOpening a teenager’s world to entrepreneurial experience not only helps them discover entrepreneurship as a possible career option but also helps them realize that there’s more potential for them as young people than they might think. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, an entrepreneurial mindset helps teens discover their inherent passion and that they can utilize it to make the world a better place.\n\n\n5. Serve Your Community:\n\nAs a young person, entrepreneurship is one of the most impactful methods of giving back to your community.\n\nYoung people rank among the most impactful and successful social entrepreneurs. Fostering your entrepreneurial drive has the potential to create value for many individuals while also creating opportunities to explore your interests and passion at the same time - a win-win situation. \n\n6. Expand Your Network:\n\nYou need your community as much as it needs you.\n\nFrom gaining new business perspectives to raising your profile, building an entrepreneurial network of connections provides a plethora of benefits. Perfecting the art of communication, both verbal and nonverbally, can purposefully transform your image as reliable and clear - an essential skill in today’s work environment where effective interpersonal skills are a requirement for strong teams and good relationships You will learn to build not only business relationships but also meaningful, long-lasting friendships; ones that can develop into future job opportunities or connections to projects.\n\n\n\n\n7. Get Real-World Experience:\n\nLearning by doing - a hands-on approach to educating - has been known to prepare teens for the real world. \n\nAs a teenage entrepreneur, you’ll work with real clients and will have the opportunity to develop strong communication, presentation, public speaking, and strategic thinking skills, placing you miles ahead of your peers and competitors. From pitching compelling ideas to investors to acquiring customers through effective marketing strategies, entrepreneurship teaches you skills through hands-on experience that cannot be found in boring textbooks.\n\n\n\n\n8. Learn From Setbacks:\n\nThere are several defining traits of a successful entrepreneur, but there is always one integral experience that unites them all: setbacks. \n\n\tSuccess isn’t a paved path of roses, but rather one filled with mountains and jagged edges that requires practice to maneuver. You can only be successful when you are willing to view your setbacks as a temporary bump in the road and strive to reflect on it to better yourself. You will organically develop this mindset through your entrepreneurship experience, allowing you to resolve conflict effectively, apply feedback receptively, and maintain resilience actively.\n\n\n\n\n9. Become a Leader:\n\nThe world needs more superheroes. Superheroes are leaders. \n\nThey are those that can direct a team towards clear goals. Being a teen entrepreneur requires you to take on the role of a founder, who needs to recruit and train team leaders. Taking on this level of leadership is a transformative experience that will allow you to hone your strengths and improve your weaknesses. As difficulties arise along the way, you must learn to negotiate terms that benefit all employees: a skill that not all teens can develop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Understand the Business World\n\nThe business world is a vast place of experienced sharks. Traversing and understanding the business world as a teen is a gateway to future success and fulfillment. \n\nThere is so much to learn, from business models to marketing strategies; these all require years of knowledge—the number of competitors and level of risk rise every day. As a teenager, you have limited responsibilities and fewer economic pressures, all while being allowed the opportunities to take risks and experience failure, and there is no better time than now!\n\nYour Solution: 24/7 Teen Bootcamps  \n\nIn the past decade, the number of successful teenage entrepreneurs has grown exponentially, taking the business market by storm. They’ve been awarded money, recognition, and connections for their entrepreneurial pursuits. \n\nAlthough the time is now for teens to start materializing their ideas, there are inevitable barriers to success: lack of hands-on experience, networks, and credibility.

Click below.\nA Hiring Manager's Guide to hiring a Quality Instructional Designer\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nDemystifying the Hiring Process: A Hiring Manager's Guide to Selecting a Quality Instructional Designer\n\nThroughout my years as an Instructional Designer (ID), I've sat on both sides of the interview table countless times. I've been interviewed for jobs and contracts, and I've also interviewed and hired other IDs. I've noticed that many individuals responsible for hiring IDs often lack a comprehensive understanding of what we do, and their interview questions often reflect this.\n\nIn light of these experiences, I've compiled a set of tips to guide hiring managers in identifying quality candidates who truly understand the art and science of instructional design:\n\n1. Focus on Practical Application Over Years of Experience with Tools\n\nInstead of asking how many years a candidate has used a particular software program or authoring tool, ask for an example of how they've used the features of a tool or program to enhance design and interactivity. Tools constantly evolve; a competent designer can adapt to new tools and versions. What matters is the design decisions made using technology, especially in the transition from outline or storyboard to screen.\n\n2. Look Beyond the Portfolio\n\nFinished portfolios with all the bells and whistles can be deceptive. Often, projects are team efforts, and the final product might reflect the work of the graphics artist or animator more than the ID. Even the writing can be changed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) at the last minute. Instead, ask candidates to provide a narrative with the sample. What were the ID's ideas and contributions that added value to the project? This gives insight into the candidate's thought process and the design decisions they made.\n\n3. Don't Rely Solely on Resumes or LinkedIn Profiles\n\nResumes and LinkedIn profiles only tell part of the story. I've seen glowing recommendations for individuals who turned out to be barely competent when I worked with them. Instead of relying on these, ask the candidate to perform immediately. Give them a hypothetical design problem and have them provide recommendations on how they would chunk the content and add interactivity. This can reveal a lot about their practical skills and problem-solving ability.\n\n4. Understand the Value of Applied Knowledge Over Theoretical Recitation\n\nAvoid asking for a recitation of academic theories and models. While theories like ADDIE, Bloom, Gagne, and Constructivism are essential, what matters more is the candidate's ability to apply these theories effectively. Some of the best designers I've known never took a course in instructional design. Instead, ask your candidate for a personal design philosophy and what drew them to the field. Passion for learning and continuous professional development is often a good sign of a quality ID.\n\n5. Clarify Expectations and Ask for Honest Self-Appraisal\n\nDon't expect instructional designers to wear all hats: project manager, graphics artist, video producer, audio technician, computer programmer, voice-over talent, etc. It's crucial to clarify your expectations and the parameters of the job. Ask for an honest self-appraisal of skills from the start to avoid unpleasant surprises down the line. It's often easier and less expensive to train a talented individual than to redo work done by someone who made false promises.\n\n6. Recognize the Importance of Adaptability and Continuous Learning\n\nInstructional design is a rapidly evolving field. New technologies, tools, and pedagogical approaches are constantly emerging. Therefore, a quality ID is adaptable and keenly interested in continuous learning. Ask the candidate about how they keep up-to-date with the latest trends in the field. Do they read blogs and white papers or subscribe to industry newsletters? Do they attend conferences or engage in professional development activities? This will give you insight into their commitment to staying at the forefront of instructional design.\n\n7. Prioritize the Art of Communication and Collaboration\n\nInstructional design is not a solitary profession. IDs often work in teams and collaborate with diverse stakeholders, including subject matter experts, graphic designers, and developers. Hence, strong communication and collaboration skills are essential. Ask the candidate to describe a project where they had to work closely with others. How did they handle conflicts or differing opinions? How did they ensure effective communication throughout the project?\n\n8. Assess their Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking Skills\n\nAt its core, instructional design is about solving problems—how to effectively convey complex information, engage diverse learners, improve existing training materials, and so on. Present the candidate with a real or hypothetical problem related to instructional design. Ask them to walk you through their thought process in solving the problem. This will provide insight into their problem-solving, critical-thinking skills, and ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and succinctly.\n\n9. Value Passion and Enthusiasm for Learning and Teaching\n\nFinally, remember that an excellent instructional designer is someone passionate about learning and teaching. This passion often shines through in their work, creating engaging and compelling learning experiences. Ask the candidate about what sparked their interest in instructional design and what aspects of the field they are most passionate about. This can provide a glimpse into their motivation and dedication to the craft.\n\n10. Understand the Role of Constructive Feedback and Iteration\n\nA skilled instructional designer understands feedback's value and iteration's importance. They should be comfortable receiving constructive criticism and willing to revise and improve their work based on that feedback. Ask the candidate about a time they received feedback on their work. How did they respond? What changes did they make as a result?\n\nIn conclusion, hiring a quality instructional designer goes beyond evaluating their qualifications on paper. It involves a deeper understanding of their practical skills, adaptability, communication and collaboration abilities, problem-solving prowess, passion for learning, and receptiveness to feedback. By considering these elements, you're more likely to select a candidate who will bring value to your organization and create impactful learning experiences for your audience.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\n5 Key Reasons Instructional Designers Must Master Learning and Instructional Design Theories\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nA Deep Dive into the Foundations of Instructional Design and Their Impact on Creating Effective Learning Experiences.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAs a former classroom teacher who transitioned to a successful career in instructional design, I can attest to the importance of understanding both learning theory and instructional design theory. These foundations are critical for aspiring instructional designers who want to create effective learning experiences and solve organizational challenges. At 24/7 Teach, we emphasize the importance of mastering these theories before diving into authoring tools and other practical skills. In today’s post, I will guide you through the significance of learning theory and instructional design theory, how to use them, and when to prioritize one over the other. Let's embark on this journey together and unlock your full potential as an instructional designer.\n\n1. The Importance of Learning Theory in Instructional Design:\n\nLearning theories are the foundation of instructional design. They provide a framework for understanding how people acquire knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which in turn informs the design of effective learning experiences. As an instructional designer, you must be well-versed in various learning theories, such as behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism, to create learning experiences tailored to the specific needs of your audience. Familiarity with learning theories enables you to:\n\na. Create learner-centered experiences: By understanding how people learn, you can design instruction that caters to the unique needs, preferences, and motivations of your learners.\n\nb. Facilitate meaningful learning: Learning theories provide insights into the mental processes that underlie learning, enabling you to create experiences that promote deep understanding and long-lasting knowledge retention.\n\nc. Adapt to diverse learning contexts: Different learning theories are more applicable to specific contexts, such as instructor-led training, eLearning, or blended learning. By understanding the nuances of each theory, you can adapt your instructional design approach accordingly.\n\n2. The Importance of Instructional Design Theory:\n\nInstructional design theories provide systematic, research-based guidelines for designing effective instruction. They offer a framework for selecting, sequencing, and organizing instructional materials and activities, ensuring that your learning experiences align with your objectives and audience needs. As an instructional designer, you must be familiar with various instructional design models, such as ADDIE, SAM, Gagné's Nine Events, Dick and Carey Model, Merrill’s Principles of Instruction, Kemp Design Model, and 4C/ID (Four-Component Instructional Design) to select the best approach for your project. Mastery of instructional design theory enables you to:\n\na. Design with intention: Instructional design theories provide a roadmap for creating learning experiences that effectively support your goals and objectives.\n\nb. Streamline your design process: By following a systematic instructional design model, you can optimize your workflow, save time, and ensure consistent quality across your projects.\n\nc. Evaluate and refine your instruction: Instructional design theories often include guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of your learning experiences, enabling you to identify areas for improvement and refine your instruction accordingly.\n\n3. How to Use Learning Theory and Instructional Design Theory in Practice:\n\nAs an instructional designer, your main responsibility is to solve organizational challenges or capitalize on opportunities through learning. To do this, you must:\n\na. Analyze the problem or opportunity: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the issue at hand, considering the needs of the organization, the characteristics of your learners, and the desired outcomes.\n\nb. Select the appropriate learning theory: Based on your analysis, choose a learning theory that best aligns with your audience's needs and the learning context. For example, you might opt for a constructivist approach for a collaborative, problem-based learning experience or a behaviorist approach for a compliance training program.\n\nc. Apply an instructional design model: Once you have identified the most suitable learning theory, apply a compatible instructional design model to create a structured, research-based learning experience. For example, if you're using a constructivist learning theory, you might select an instructional design model like SAM (Successive Approximation Model), which is well-suited for iterative, learner-centered projects.\n\nd. Design and develop the learning experience: With a solid foundation in both learning theory and instructional design theory, you can now design and develop your learning experience. Keep in mind the principles and guidelines of your chosen theories, and use them to inform your decisions on content, instructional strategies, and assessment methods.\n\ne. Evaluate and refine: Finally, assess the effectiveness of your learning experience using the evaluation methods outlined in your instructional design model. Gather feedback from your learners and stakeholders, and use this information to refine your instruction and ensure continuous improvement.\n\n4. When to Use Learning Theory vs. Instructional Design Theory:\n\nAs an instructional designer, it's crucial to recognize that learning theory and instructional design theory are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they complement each other and should be used in tandem to create effective learning experiences. However, there are instances when one might take precedence over the other:\n\na. Focus on learning theory: When designing instruction for a specific audience or learning context, you might prioritize learning theory to ensure your instruction aligns with your learners' needs, preferences, and motivations. For example, if you're designing a course for adult learners, you may focus on principles from andragogy, a learning theory that emphasizes the unique needs of adult learners.\n\nb. Focus on instructional design theory: In cases where you need to develop a systematic, replicable process for designing instruction, you might prioritize instructional design theory. For example, if you're working within a large organization with multiple instructional designers or need to create a scalable training program, applying a consistent instructional design model can help streamline your process and ensure quality.\n\n5. The 24/7 Teach Approach: Learning Theory and Instructional Design Theory First\n\nAt 24/7 Teach, we believe that a deep understanding of learning theory and instructional design theory is essential for aspiring instructional designers. Before diving into authoring tools and practical skills, our learners focus on mastering these foundational theories. This approach equips them with the knowledge and skills they need to create effective learning experiences, regardless of the medium.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMastering the foundations of learning theory and instructional design theory is paramount for instructional designers seeking to create impactful and effective learning experiences. Understanding these theories enables you to design learner-centered experiences, facilitate meaningful learning, and adapt to diverse learning contexts. Furthermore, applying instructional design theory helps streamline your design process, allowing for intentional design, evaluation, and continuous improvement.\n\nFor me, as an instructional designer, it's essential to strike a balance between learning theory and instructional design theory to create learning experiences that meet the unique needs of your audience while maintaining a systematic, research-based approach. By prioritizing a deep understanding of these foundational theories, you can unlock your full potential and contribute to the growth and success of your organization.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENS\nMEGA FOR TEENS\nFOR ADULTS\nMEGA FOR ADULTS\nFOR ORGANIZATIONS\nMEGA FOR ORGANIZATIONS\nNEWS & FREE RESOURCES\nMEGA FOR NEWS\nABOUT US\nWhy learning Real Estate as a Teenager can be a key for Success.\n\nLearning about real estate and real estate investing as a teen has many incredible benefits and advantages that can help them succeed in college and their careers.  It can help teach valuable life lessons about credit, debt, and generational wealth creation.  It can also improve skills like critical thinking, communication, risk analysis, and budgeting and eventually help them grow professionally and financially. \n\nWhile investing in real estate as a teen is highly beneficial, there will be some obstacles that teens might experience.  According to an article written by Paul Esajian titled, “Millennial’s Guide to Investing in Real Estate At Young Age,” he breaks down the different challenges a teenager will face as a young investor.  These challenges include starting a business, lacking resources, ineffective communication, and self-doubt. \n\nReal estate investing for teens might seem like a daunting task, but with patience, understanding, the right information, and mentorship, there is nothing that will stop them.  The best way for teens to overcome these obstacles is to truly educate themselves about real estate and learn the skills needed to become successful.\n\nIf your teen is interested in learning more about these skills, I recommend that your teen register for 24/7 Teach’s next “Introduction to Real Estate for Teens Bootcamp.Some of the skills practiced in this boot camp are real estate mathematics and finance, law analysis, sales and marketing, and real estate investing.  By the end of this course, your teen will also develop skills such as:\n\nTime management and organization\n\nTime management is a skill used and needed in all areas of life whether in school or at work. Time management is a skill that can help your teen prioritize assignments to ensure that they have enough time available to complete a project. If your teen is interested in a real estate career after completing 24/7 Teach’s introduction to real estate boot camp for teens, time management will definitely be a skill needed. Your teen can use the extra time they have to begin networking and joining networking groups.\n\nNetworking at a young age with real estate agents, professionals, brokers, contractors, and other investors will help teens to make money as they get older. With the extra time they have, your teen can prepare a business plan, come up with branding ideas, create a name for their business and so on. The more time invested, the more money teens will make when they reach adulthood.\n\nCommunication with clarity and precision\n\nCommunication with clarity and precision is an important skill to have and learn. With clear communication, your teen is able to allow others and themselves to understand information more accurately and quickly. Whether it’s during a group project at school or at work, good communication skills can help build trust, strengthen professional relationships, improve teamwork, and help your teen to become more productive.\n\nOnline research\n\nOnline research skills are essential to have throughout college and your career. Research skills can help your teen gather and analyze information, think critically, and build knowledge. This skill also enables your teen to understand the world around them better.\n\nSocial media marketing\n\nMany teens have knowledge of social media and technology. They can use their knowledge of social media and technology to market their property for rent. Social media helps teens to narrow down who they want their audience to be and helps to capture that audience’s attention. A teen’s knowledge of social media and technology can also be used to research properties that are in the area and the returns they can gain from them.\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nEntrepreneurship will teach your teen essential life skills such as an innovative approach to solving a problem, resolving real-world problems, collaboration and working with a team, and so on.\n\nThe skills learned and the successful habits your teen will develop after completing this bootcamp will provide your teen with the confidence they need to approach other investors and real estate professionals.  Gaining that confidence and knowledge in this course, can help your teen overcome the feeling of self-doubt and not being taken seriously, as well as provide them with resources to make their investment in real estate a success.  Our real estate investment boot camp for teens will teach your teen life, career, and technical skills hands-on, to help them become more marketable, hirable, and college and career-ready.\n\nDon't forget to share this post and comment below!\nDoes your Teen want to try real estate investing? \nCheck out our Introduction to Real Estate Boot Camp for Teens :\nLEARN MORE > START YOUR TEEN’S JOURNEY TO BECOME A REAL ESTATE INVESTOR →\nUse the discount code below to receive a 10% discount:\nGet the latest 24/7 News\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\n4 Reasons why Real Estate Investing should be taught in High Schools\n10 Reasons why all Teens Should Become Entrepreneurs before the age of 18.\nHave questions?

Click below.\nWhy all 24/7 Teach Instructional Designers are trained on how to use ChatGPT, and so should you.\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nSupercharge Your Instructional Design Career - Harness the Power of ChatGPT.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAs an experienced instructional designer and AI enthusiast, I've seen firsthand the transformative impact that cutting-edge technologies like ChatGPT can have on our industry. In this post, I will guide you through leveraging ChatGPT and 24/7’s AI-Instructional Design Assistant in your instructional design practice, sharing the best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and why incorporating AI can boost your chances of getting hired. Are you ready to become an in-demand instructional design pro? Let's dive in!\n\n1. Understanding ChatGPT and Its Potential:\n\nChatGPT is a powerful AI language model that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. This groundbreaking technology can potentially revolutionize how instructional designers create content and engage learners. ChatGPT can help you deliver highly personalized and engaging learning experiences, from generating course materials to providing on-demand support.\n\n2. Best Practices for Using ChatGPT in Instructional Design:\n\na.Our Instructional Design Team Starts with Clear Objectives: To make the most of ChatGPT, begin by defining the learning objectives for your course or module. This will help you focus your AI-generated content on critical topics and ensure it aligns with your instructional goals. It also helps to create learner personas, so you can better understand the needs and motivations of your target audience. You'll make engaging and impactful learning experiences by tailoring your content to specific learner personas.\n\nb. We constantly practice using prompts effectively: When working with ChatGPT, providing clear and concise prompts is essential to generating relevant and impactful content. You'll discover the optimal approach for your specific use case by experimenting with different prompt styles and phrasings. To unlock the power of ChatGPT for instructional design, we encourage you to enroll in our complimentary mini-course: ChatGPT Prompting for Instructional Designers.\n\nOur training specifically focuses on the following:\n\nCraft effective prompts for diverse learning objectives\n\nOptimize your prompts for maximum AI-generated value\n\nTailor your prompts to suit the unique needs of your learners\n\nTroubleshoot common issues and improve your prompting techniques\n\nc. Iteration and refinement are constant within our design processes: Like any AI tool, ChatGPT may not always generate the perfect response on the first try. Be prepared to revise and refine the content, using your instructional design expertise to ensure the final output meets your learners' needs.\n\nd. AI-generated content is always blended in with our expertise: While ChatGPT can be an invaluable tool for generating content quickly, it's essential to balance AI-generated content and your instructional design insights. Use ChatGPT as a starting point, and then apply your expertise in learning theory to tailor the content for your targeted learners.\n\n3. Pitfalls We Avoid When Using ChatGPT:\n\na. Relying solely on AI: ChatGPT is a powerful tool, but it should not replace your instructional design skills and expertise. Remember that AI-generated content should be seen as a supplement, not a replacement, for your professional judgment and insight.\n\nb. Ignoring content accuracy: Although ChatGPT can generate human-like content, it may not always be accurate or up-to-date. Always verify the information generated by the AI, especially when dealing with complex or rapidly evolving subject matter.\n\nc. Overusing AI-generated content: While ChatGPT can create engaging content, it's important not to overuse it in your instructional design projects. Strive to maintain a balance between AI-generated content and other forms of learning materials to provide well-rounded learning experiences. Balance and purpose should always be first and foremost in terms of your designs.\n\n4. Why All Instructional Designers Should Be Using ChatGPT\n\na. Enhanced productivity: Our Instructional Design team and students have learned that ChatGPT can save them time and effort by quickly generating the content, supporting SME (subject matter experts) resources, and allowing them to focus on other aspects instructional design, such as learner engagement and assessment development.\n\nb. Personalized learning experiences: AI tools like ChatGPT help us create highly personalized learning experiences, tailoring content to individual learners' needs and preferences. This can lead to increased learner engagement and improved learning outcomes.\n\nc. Staying ahead of the curve: We have learned that as the instructional design field evolves, incorporating cutting-edge technologies like ChatGPT helps our Instructional Design team, and students stay competitive and enhance their skills to compete in a very competitive market.

It showcases their adaptability: By incorporating ChatGPT into their instructional design projects, they demonstrate their ability to adapt to new technologies and stay current in the rapidly evolving field.

They value candidates who can keep up with industry trends and leverage cutting-edge tools to create compelling learning experiences.\n\nb. They Stand out from the competition: Utilizing AI tools like ChatGPT in your portfolio projects will help you differentiate yourself from other instructional designers.

You are overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to learn and find yourself forgetting key concepts and details. Determined to improve your study habits, you enroll in a learning and studying techniques workshop. In that workshop, you learn about several excellent study techniques. \n\nYour final assignment is to choose a study technique to research and prepare to debate why you think that study technique is the best. Also, provide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nIn the last lesson, you learned about the principles of effective learning. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn more about the spaced practice study technique, its benefits, and how it can be applied to study routines. \n\nRemember to take notes on the pros and cons of spaced practice. You will need to choose one of the study routines to debate later. \n\nLearning Objectives \nBy the end of this lesson, learners will be able to…\n\nExplain the benefits of spaced practice for long-term memory retention\n\nDifferentiate spaced practice from other types of learning\n\nIncorporate spacing into study routine\n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading: \nTo be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions.\n\nWhat is spacing, and how does it differ from cramming when it comes to studying? \n\nWhy is spacing an effective study technique? \n\nLesson 2: Spaced Practice\nWhat is this technique?\n\nSpaced practice is a technique for learning and retaining information that involves spacing out study or practice sessions over time. \n\nIn spaced practice, a learner will study a particular topic or practice a particular skill and then wait for a period before revisiting that topic or skill. The idea is that by spacing out the practice or study sessions, the learner is more likely to remember the information or skill over the long term. \n\nResearch shows that spaced practice is more effective than cramming or trying to learn everything in a single session. The brain needs time to consolidate information and build strong neural connections. By spacing out practice sessions, the learner can reinforce and strengthen those neural connections over time, leading to better retention and recall of the information. \n\nBenefits of spaced practice? \n\nSpacing out study sessions helps to strengthen the memory trace, making it more durable and more accessible to retrieve later.\n\nBetter understanding: Spacing out study sessions gives you time to reflect on the material and understand it deeper rather than just memorizing it.\n\nReduced stress: Spreading out study sessions over time reduces the pressure to remember everything at once, lowering stress levels and increasing motivation.\n\nIncreased engagement: Spacing out study sessions allows you to review and revise the material, which can help you stay focused and engaged in the learning process.\n\nImproved long-term retention: Research has shown that spacing out study sessions, as opposed to cramming, leads to better long-term retention of information.\n\nImproved application of information: By spacing out study sessions and giving yourself time to reflect on the material, you can think about how you might apply the knowledge in real-world situations, which can help to solidify the memory.\n\nWays to incorporate spacing into your study routine: \n\nHere are some tips for incorporating the method of spacing into your study sessions: \n\nPlan ahead: Instead of cramming all your studying into one session, plan a study schedule in advance. This will help you space out your study sessions over time and ensure enough time to cover all the material you need to learn.  \n\nUse a calendar or planner: Use a calendar or planner to schedule your study sessions. This will help you see when your study sessions are happening and ensure that you’re spacing them out effectively.  \n\nReview material regularly: Instead of reviewing material only once, make a habit of reviewing it regularly. This will help reinforce the material in your memory and improve your ability to recall it.  \n\nTake breaks: When you’re studying, take regular breaks to give your brain a chance to rest and consolidate the information. This will help you practice retrieval and improve your ability to transfer knowledge between different topics.  \n\nPractice active recall: Instead of just reading through your notes, practice active recall by testing yourself on the material. This will help you strengthen your memory and improve your recall of information later. \n\nClosing Assessment: \n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should know the following: \n\nUnderstand what spaced practice is, its benefits, and how it can be incorporated into your study routine. \n\nCOMPLETE THE LESSON 2 ASSESSMENT\nAdvance your understanding by participating in the 24/7 Discussion Forum: \n\nPlease answer the following question in the comment section below and interact with learners from around the world. \n\nReflect on a previous learning experience where spacing could have been helpful. Discuss how you could have used spacing in that situation and the potential impact it could have had on the outcome of your learning.\n\nPlease read and reply to other learners’ answers in the forum by stating if you agree or disagree with their answers and why. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. \n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nLesson 1: Understanding Effective Learning\nLesson 3: Interleaving or Mixed Practice\nHave questions?

Also, provide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nAs you go through this workshop, we want you to take notes on the study techniques (spaced practice, interleaving, and retrieval practice) and note the pros and cons of each. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the principles of effective learning, including asking questions, participating in discussions, taking notes, asking for feedback, and metacognition.\n\nLesson Objectives:\nBy the end of this lesson, learners will be able to…\n\nIdentify and understand the principles of effective learning. \n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading: \nTo be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nChoose a study technique discussed in this lesson. What are the pros and cons of this particular study technique? \n\nCan you use the study technique as an example? \n\nPre-Assessment: \nCOMPLETE THE PRE-ASSESSMENT\n\nPlease complete a short effective learning assessment. \n\nLesson 1: Understanding Effective Learning\nThe Principles of Effective Learning \n\nEffective learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills that can be retained and applied over time. Here are some key principles of effective learning:\n\nAsk questions: It is important to note that asking questions can sometimes feel intimidating or uncomfortable, especially if you are in a large class or feel like you may be asking a \"stupid\" question. However, it is important to remember that asking questions is a valuable learning strategy, and your questions may help others with similar questions. Additionally, most instructors appreciate and encourage questions, showing that you are actively engaged with the material. \n\nHere are some tips for asking better questions:\n\nBe curious: Approach class with a curious mindset and be willing to ask questions about anything that you don't understand or find interesting.\n\nListen actively: Listen to what the teacher or other students are saying, and use their comments to guide your questions.\n\nBe specific: Ask specific questions focused on a particular topic or concept. Vague questions are more difficult to answer and can lead to confusion.\n\nUse open-ended questions: Ask open-ended questions that encourage discussion and a deeper understanding of the material.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for clarification: If you don't understand something, ask the teacher or another student to explain it in a different way.\n\n2. Participate in Discussions: Class discussions can help you engage with the material, hear different perspectives, and develop your critical thinking skills. Here are some best practices for participating in discussions as a student:\n\nPrepare in advance: Review the reading material or lecture notes before class to ensure you are prepared for the discussion. Think about the key points and questions you want to raise.\n\nListen actively: Listen carefully to what others say and avoid interrupting or talking over them. Show respect for other viewpoints and be open to different perspectives.\n\nBuild on others' comments: When you participate in the discussion, try to build on others' comments rather than repeating them. This can help generate new ideas and insights.\n\nShare personal experiences: Sharing personal experiences can help make the discussion more relevant and engaging. It can also help you connect the material to real-world situations.\n\nUse evidence: Use evidence to support your arguments and opinions. This can include citing research studies, referencing the reading material, or providing examples from your experience.\n\nBe concise: Try to make your points clearly and concisely. Avoid going off on tangents or getting too caught up in minor details.\n\nParticipate regularly: Regular participation in class discussions can help you stay engaged with the material and deepen your understanding of the topic. Try to participate regularly and consistently throughout the semester. Remember that participating in class discussions is a skill that can be developed over time. \n\n3. Take Notes: Notes can help you stay focused and engaged in the material. It can also help you organize and remember information better. \n\nHere are some tips for taking better notes in class:\n\nBe prepared: Bring all necessary materials to class, including pens, pencils, highlighters, notebooks, and textbooks. Arrive early to class and organize your materials, so you are ready to take notes.\n\nUse a consistent format: Develop a consistent note-taking format that works for you. This may include headings, bullet points, abbreviations, or diagrams. Using a consistent format will make it easier to review and study your notes later.\n\nListen actively: Pay attention to what the instructor is saying and take notes on the most important points. Don't try to write down everything; this can be overwhelming and distract you from the lecture.\n\nUse abbreviations: Using abbreviations and symbols can help you take notes more quickly and efficiently. For example, you could use \"w/\" for \"with\" or \"&\" for \"and\".\n\nHighlight key information: Use a highlighter or underline important information, such as definitions, examples, and key concepts. This will make it easier to review your notes later and identify important information.\n\nReview and revise: After class, review and revise your notes while the material is still fresh in your mind. Add any missing information, clarify any confusing points, and organize your notes for easier studying.\n\nSummarize: Create a summary of the main points covered in the lecture. This will help you remember the key concepts and make it easier to review and study the material.\n\n4. Take Breaks: Taking breaks can help you stay focused and engaged. You can use breaks to reflect on your learning, stretch your body, or take a mental break.\n\n5. Ask for Feedback: We know that feedback is often a dreaded word. However, constructive feedback is how we learn. Please do not take constructive feedback personally. We know that this is easier said than done, but try to find the truth in any feedback. Constructive feedback helps us understand where we stand and what we need to improve.\n\n6. Metacognition: Metacognition involves reflecting on one's learning process and understanding the material. This can help learners identify areas of weakness and develop effective learning strategies.\n\nMetacognition can be broken down into three main components:\n\nPlanning: Before starting a learning task, individuals must set goals, develop strategies, and organize their thoughts.\n\nMonitoring: During the learning task, individuals need to keep track of their progress, check their understanding, and identify areas where they may be struggling.\n\nEvaluating: After completing the learning task, individuals need to assess their own performance, reflect on what they have learned, and identify areas for improvement.\n\nClosing Assessment Questions:\n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should know the following: \n\nThe basic principles of effective learning techniques. \n\nCOMPLETE THE LESSON 1 ASSESSMENT\nAdvance your understanding: \n\nPlease answer the following questions in the comment section below and interact with learners from around the world. \n\nWhat is your favorite effective learning technique so far? Please provide an example of how you could use the technique in your own life.  \n\nPlease read and reply to other learners’ answers in the forum by stating if you agree or disagree with their answers and why. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. \n\nLesson 2: Spaced Practice\nHave questions?

Click below.\nNavigating the Presentation Interview as an Instructional Designer in 2023 By: Zaynah Danquah\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nMastering the Presentation Interview - A Comprehensive Guide for Aspiring Instructional Designers:\n\nWhen I first began my journey into the field of instructional design, one of the most intimidating hurdles I faced was the presentation interview. I was comfortable creating content and working behind the scenes, but when it came to defending my design choices in front of a panel of professionals, my confidence wavered. In hindsight, I understood the importance of this process and its pivotal role in determining an instructional designer’s ability to communicate effectively and justify their design choices. What I struggled with was how to shift from simply describing my or my teams product to organizing my presentation in a way that emphasized what panelists valued most. Allow me to share my experiences and insights, hoping that it will provide you with a better understanding and a more prepared approach to the instructional designer’s presentation interview in 2023.\n\nA common phrase you’ll hear in the industry is that “design is never done in a vacuum”. This holds true for instructional design as well. As an instructional designer, you’re not merely creating learning materials; you’re shaping an experience that is meant to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills to diverse learners. Your designs are expected to address specific learning objectives, keeping in view the unique needs and contexts of your target audience. This makes it crucial for instructional designers to not only create effective designs but also to communicate the ‘why’ behind their design decisions convincingly. That’s where the presentation interview comes in.\n\nCommunicating Your Design Choices:\n\nDuring the interview, the panel is looking to assess your ability to present and defend your design choices effectively. Can you articulate why you’ve chosen a particular instructional strategy? Can you explain why your design will work for your target learners? Can you handle feedback and critique professionally and thoughtfully? These are the kinds of skills you should be prepared to demonstrate. In preparation for my presentation interview, I learned that a well-structured presentation is critical. Start by providing a brief overview of the project, outlining the learning objectives, target audience, and the challenges you were tasked to overcome. Then, delve into the specifics of your design. Talk about why you’ve chosen a particular instructional strategy or multimedia tool. Discuss how your design addresses the learning objectives and meets the target audience's needs. Be prepared to provide concrete examples to support your design decisions. Remember, the panel is interested in your thought process. They want to see that you have a deep understanding of instructional design principles, learning theories, and multimedia tools and that you can apply this knowledge to create learning experiences that are engaging, relevant, and effective.\n\nPreparing for Tough Questions:\n\nWhile explaining your designs, be mindful of the questions you might face. You could be asked, “Why did you choose this particular design approach?” or “How did you incorporate feedback into your designs?” or “How would you measure the effectiveness of your designs?\" Being prepared to answer these questions can make a big difference. It shows the panel that you are reflective and critical about your work and value feedback and continuous improvement. It’s also important to remember that the presentation interview is about explaining your designs and demonstrating your presentation skills. As an instructional designer, you may be required to present your designs to stakeholders or provide training to subject matter experts or content developers. Therefore, your ability to present clearly, confidently, and effectively is crucial. When I stood in front of that panel, I felt a mix of nerves and excitement. But as I started to talk about my designs - the thought process behind them, the challenges I overcame, the feedback I incorporated - I began to feel more confident. I realized that the presentation interview was not a test but an opportunity to showcase my passion for instructional design and my commitment to creating meaningful learning experiences. As I wrapped up my presentation and fielded questions from the panel, I realized that I was not only defending my designs, but I was also learning. I was getting insights into different perspectives and broadening my understanding of instructional design. The presentation interview, I realized, is as much an opportunity for personal growth as it is a showcase of your skills and competencies. It’s a chance for dialogue and exchange of ideas, a chance to learn from seasoned professionals and gain insights that can help you become a better instructional designer.\n\nShowcasing Your Talent:\n\nIn the course of the interview, you will most likely face challenging questions. This is not merely a test of your knowledge but an opportunity for you to demonstrate your problem-solving skills. For instance, when asked, “How would you alter your design if the audience was different?” you’re not just being asked to come up with an alternate design on the spot. The underlying question is whether you understand that different audiences have different needs and whether you have the skills to adapt your designs to meet these changing needs. In other words, the panel wants to see your flexibility and adaptability in action. Equally important is your response to the critique. As a designer, receiving feedback and criticism is a part of the job. How you handle this critique during the interview can tell the panel a lot about you as a professional. Do you get defensive, or do you listen and consider the feedback thoughtfully? Can you accept that there might be room for improvement in your designs? Your reaction to critique can show the panel your level of professionalism, your openness to learning, and your commitment to continuous improvement – all essential qualities of a successful instructional designer. Through my presentation interview, I learned that being an instructional designer is not just about creating great designs but also about being able to articulate the ‘why’ behind your designs. It’s about being able to defend your design choices with well-reasoned arguments and concrete evidence. It’s about being able to accept critique and use it as a springboard for growth and improvement.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the presentation interview is an integral part of the hiring process for instructional designers. It provides a platform for you to showcase your design skills, your communication abilities, and your critical thinking skills. It’s an opportunity to show the panel that you’re not just a designer but a thoughtful and reflective practitioner who is committed to creating the best learning experiences for your learners.\n\nAs intimidating as the presentation interview may seem, remember that it’s an opportunity – an opportunity to share your passion for instructional design, engage in stimulating discussions, and learn from seasoned professionals. With thorough preparation and a positive mindset, you can turn the presentation interview into a rewarding and enriching experience. I did it, and I’m sure you can too. The journey of becoming an instructional designer can be challenging, but it’s a journey worth embarking on.

Click below: \nLesson 3: Interleaving or Mixed Practice\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\nImagine you are a learner struggling to keep up with coursework. You are overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to learn and find yourself forgetting key concepts and details. Determined to improve your study habits, you enroll in a learning and studying techniques workshop. In that workshop, you learn about several excellent study techniques. \n\nYour final assignment is to choose a study technique to research and prepare to debate why you think that study technique is the best. Also, provide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nIn the last lesson, you learned about the spaced practice technique. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn more about the interleaving study technique. \n\nRemember to take notes on the pros and cons of interleaving. You will need to choose one of the study routines to debate later.\n\nLearning Objectives \nBy the end of this lesson, learners will be able to…\n\nUnderstand interleaving and mixed practice for long-term memory\n\nExplain the benefits of these study techniques\n\nCreate a personalized study routine by applying interleaving and mixed practice \n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading: \nTo be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat is interleaving, and how can it benefit learners?\n\nWhat are the potential benefits of interleaving for memory retention, problem-solving skills, transfer of learning, motivation, and reduced boredom in the learning process?\n\nLesson 3: What is Interleaving or Mixed Practice?\nWhat is Interleaving?\n\nInterleaving, also known as mixed practice, is a learning technique that involves practicing different topics or skills in an alternating or randomized order rather than focusing on one skill at a time. This approach helps learners to better retain and apply knowledge by enhancing their ability to differentiate between different types of problems and strategies, as well as promoting deeper learning and transfer of learning to new situations.\n\nBenefits of interleaving topics\n\nThe benefits of interleaving topics in learning include improved knowledge transfer, enhanced problem-solving skills, improved memory retention, increased motivation, and reduced boredom. Interleaving involves practicing different topics or skills in an alternating or randomized order rather than focusing on one skill at a time. It can make the learning process more engaging, interesting, and effective.\n\nImproved transfer of learning: Interleaving can improve the transfer of learning, which refers to the ability to apply what has been learned in one context to another context. Interleaving helps learners to develop more flexible and adaptable knowledge by promoting the creation of connections and associations between different topics or skills. This enhances learners' ability to transfer their knowledge and skills to new situations and solve problems that require integrating multiple skills or concepts. \n\nEnhanced problem-solving skills: Interleaving can improve problem-solving skills. By practicing different topics or skills in an interleaved and randomized order, learners are forced to retrieve and apply their knowledge more varied and flexibly. This helps them better understand how different concepts or skills relate and how to use them in other contexts. As a result, learners become more adept at solving complex and unfamiliar problems that require integrating multiple skills or concepts and more creative in their problem-solving approaches.\n\nImproved memory retention: Interleaving can improve memory retention. Interleaving involves practicing different topics or skills in an alternating or randomized order rather than focusing on one skill at a time. This approach helps reinforce learning by creating connections and associations between different concepts or skills, promoting deeper encoding and retention of information in long-term memory. By practicing in an interleaved manner, learners are also forced to retrieve and apply their knowledge in a more varied and flexible way, which can further enhance memory retention and retrieval.\n\n Increased motivation: ​​Interleaving may increase motivation for some learners. Practicing different topics or skills in an interleaved and randomized order exposes learners to various tasks, making learning more exciting and engaging. This approach can also help learners overcome boredom or frustration from repeatedly practicing the same skill or topic. However, it's important to note that the impact of interleaving on motivation can vary depending on the individual learner and the specific learning context.\n\n Reduced boredom: Interleaving can reduce boredom in the learning process. Learners who practice different topics or skills in an interleaved and randomized order are exposed to various tasks and less likely to become bored or disengaged. This is in contrast to a blocked practice approach, where learners practice the same skill or topic repeatedly, which can lead to monotony and disengagement. Interleaving can help learners stay motivated and focused on their learning goals by keeping the learning process exciting and challenging.\n\nWays for incorporating interleaving into your study routine\n\nTo incorporate interleaving into your study routine, choose a mix of subjects or skills and vary the study order. Use a structured approach and reflect on your process to identify what worked well and what didn't to improve your learning outcomes.\n\nChoose a mix of subjects or skills: To practice interleaving, select a combination of topics or skills you want to study. This can be different school subjects or skills related to a particular subject.\n\nVary the order of study: Rather than studying one subject or skill for an extended period, mix up the order of study. For example, if you're studying math, you could practice different types of problems or concepts in alternating or randomized order.\n\nUse a structured approach: To ensure you cover all the topics or skills you want to study, use a structured approach. You could create a schedule or plan that specifies which topics or skills you'll study on which days and in what order.\n\nReflect on your process: After practicing interleaving, reflect on your method to identify what worked well and what didn't. This can help refine your study routine and improve your learning outcomes.\n\nClosing Assessment: \n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should know the following:\n\nWhat is interleaving, and how can it benefit learners?\n\nCOMPLETE THE LESSON 3 ASSESSMENT\nAdvance your understanding: \n\nPlease answer the following question in the comment section below and interact with learners from around the world. \n\nDo you think interleaving is a technique that could be applied to all subject areas? Why or why not?\n\nPlease read and reply to other learners’ answers in the forum by stating if you agree or disagree with their answers and why. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. \n\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nLesson 2: Spaced Practice\nLesson 4: Quizzing or Retrieval Practice\nHave questions?

As a teen, I often wondered how to make my life easier. Now, as a college student, I realize all I needed was self-confidence. If confidence is the key to conquering teen life, then social skills are the key to becoming self-confident. Our schools do a good job of academically preparing us. But our schools don’t always teach us the social skills we need to cope with real life problems. We’re taught how to be productive individuals, but not necessarily healthy human beings. If you’re dealing with low self-esteem, fear no more. Here’s your ultimate guide to survive those awkward teen moments.\n\n Read More\nHave questions?

Click below.\nHow to Transition from Classroom Teacher to Instructional Designer in One Year\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nHow to Transition from Educator to Instructional Designer and Get Hired:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAre you an educator looking to transition into the world of instructional design? As a former educator who successfully shifted gears to become an experienced instructional designer, recruiter, and entrepreneur, I understand the challenges and opportunities this career change can bring. In this comprehensive post, I will guide you through the process of getting hired as an instructional designer and transitioning out of the classroom within a year. It's important to recognize that what gets you hired is your practical experience, approach to problem-solving, ability to work in diverse teams, to navigate the unknown, learn and make use of new technologies, and finding comfort in uncomfortable situations. Just like an architect designing a building, instructional designers are architects of learning and training experiences. Having a master's or even a Ph.D. in instructional design does not guarantee a job; real-world application and experience do. \n\n1.Embrace the Architect Mindset:\n\nAs an instructional designer, you will be responsible for creating the blueprint of learning experiences, which is distinct from the role of an educator who implements lessons in the classroom. Adopting an \"architect mindset\" will help you understand the scope of your new role and approach design projects with the appropriate level of planning, creativity, and foresight.\n\n2. Understand the Instructional Designer's Role and Requirements:\n\nBefore you embark on your transition journey, it's crucial to understand the role of an instructional designer and its requirements. Instructional designers work with subject matter experts, multimedia designers, and other stakeholders to create engaging and effective learning experiences across various platforms. Key skills required include:\n\nInstructional design methodologies and tools (e.g., ADDIE, SAM, or Agile)\n\nCurriculum development\n\neLearning authoring tools (e.g., Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate)\n\nLearning management systems (LMS)\n\nProject management\n\nCommunication and Collaboration\n\n3. Develop Your Instructional Design Skill Set:\n\nIdentify which skills from your background as an educator can be transferred to instructional design, such as lesson planning, assessment design, or classroom management. Then, invest time in acquiring new skills, such as eLearning authoring tools and instructional design methodologies. Online courses, workshops, and professional organizations can provide valuable resources for building your knowledge.\n\n4. Gain Practical Experience:\n\nUndertaking authentic instructional design projects is crucial for cultivating self-assurance and demonstrating your capabilities. Consider volunteering your expertise for non-profit organizations or educational institutions to acquire invaluable experience and broaden your network of industry professionals. Furthermore, explore freelance or part-time instructional design roles to develop a well-rounded portfolio. Aim to complete as many real-world projects as possible, as hypothetical assignments, while beneficial for honing technical skills, will not guarantee employment. The reason behind this is that anyone can replicate a project and present it as their own. Moreover, a successful instructional designer's prowess extends beyond instructional frameworks and delves into effective collaboration with others and adeptness in navigating uncertainty and change. \n\n5. Create a Compelling Portfolio:\n\nYour portfolio is a crucial tool in demonstrating your instructional design experience and skills to potential employers. Include a variety of projects that showcase your abilities, such as eLearning modules, instructor-led training materials, job aids, and assessments. Provide context for each project, highlighting the problem addressed, the process followed, and the outcome. An online portfolio is preferred, as it allows for easy access and sharing with potential employers.\n\n6. Network and Leverage Your Existing Connections:\n\nNetworking plays a significant role in any job search, including for instructional designers. Attend industry conferences, join LinkedIn groups, and participate in local meetups to connect with others in the field. Leverage your existing connections, such as former colleagues and mentors, who may be able to introduce you to potential opportunities.\n\n7. Tailor Your Resume and Cover Letter:\n\nWhen applying for instructional design positions, ensure your resume and cover letter highlight your relevant experience and skills. Be specific about your accomplishments and how they relate to the instructional design field. Tailor your application materials for each position, demonstrating your understanding of the company's needs and how you can contribute to their success.\n\n8. Prepare for Interviews:\n\nDuring interviews, you can expect to be questioned about your instructional design projects, problem-solving strategies, and teamwork dynamics. To prepare, rehearse responses to typical interview questions, incorporating concrete examples from your past experiences. Be prepared to discuss your aptitude for handling uncertainty and thriving in challenging situations, as these are crucial skills for instructional designers. You will likely need to respond to situational inquiries that necessitate actual field experience, and you may be asked to complete a project, present it, and elucidate your design process and instructional design methodology. Experience, approach, skillset, and confidence wins the interview, everytime.  \n\n9. Be Persistent and Keep Learning:\n\nTransitioning to a new career can be challenging, but persistence is key. Continue applying for positions, refining your application materials, and networking with professionals in the field. Remember that rejection is a normal part of the job search process, so don't get discouraged.\n\nIn the meantime, continue learning and growing in your instructional design skills. Stay up-to-date with industry trends, attend workshops, and participate in online forums to remain competitive in the job market. By consistently improving your skills and knowledge, you will become a more attractive candidate to potential employers.\n\nCelebrate Your Successes:\n\nAs you make progress in your transition, take the time to acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments. This might include completing a new instructional design project, gaining a new skill, or landing an interview. Celebrating your successes will help maintain your motivation and confidence throughout the process.\n\nReflect and Adjust:\n\nThroughout your transition journey, take the time to reflect on your progress and identify areas where you can improve. This might include refining your networking strategy, improving your eLearning design skills, or seeking additional feedback on your portfolio. By regularly assessing your progress and making adjustments, you increase your chances of successfully transitioning into instructional design.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTransitioning from an educator to an instructional designer is achievable within a year if you are willing to put in the effort and follow the steps outlined in this post. Focus on embracing the architect mindset, building your instructional design skill set, gaining practical experience, showcasing your skills through a portfolio, and networking with industry professionals. By demonstrating your problem-solving abilities, ability to work in diverse teams, and confidence in the role, you will set yourself apart as a strong candidate in the instructional design field. Stay persistent, keep learning, and celebrate your successes along the way, and you'll soon find yourself thriving in your new career as an instructional designer.  \n\nAt 24/7 Teach, we take pride in our proven track record of training and collaborating with countless instructional designers, including many who transitioned from classroom teaching roles.

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENS\nMEGA FOR TEENS\nFOR ADULTS\nMEGA FOR ADULTS\nFOR ORGANIZATIONS\nMEGA FOR ORGANIZATIONS\nNEWS & FREE RESOURCES\nMEGA FOR NEWS\nABOUT US\n4 Reasons why Real Estate Investing should be taught in High Schools\n\nWhy isn't real estate investing taught in high schools?\n\nOne of the basic needs in life is shelter, so why do most people learn about real estate and real estate investing as an adult?\n\nImagine learning the concepts of real estate and generational wealth as a teenager or working to buy your first real estate property before the age of 18.\n\nImagine what your life would be like now if you had that knowledge and successfully purchased that property.\n\nThink of the skills you would need to succeed like saving and budgeting, building credit, research, finance, communication, and community prospecting, to name a few. \n\nDuring these times, aren't those skills just as necessary as writing a great essay or completing an algebra problem?\n\n\n\n\nFor that reason, I say Real estate investing has to be taught in schools, and here is why: \n\n1. Owning real estate is a tried and true way to build long-term wealth. Unlike stocks and other investments that can go up and down in value, well-located real estate typically appreciates over time. This provides a hedge against inflation and enables investors to build equity that can be tapped for other purposes, such as funding retirement or financing education.\n\n2. Real estate investing is relatively simple to understand and implement. With the help of a qualified professional, even a novice investor can get started with a reasonable amount of capital.\n\n3. There are myriad opportunities in the real estate market, ranging from fixer-uppers to luxury properties. This means that there is an investment option for every budget and risk tolerance level. For these reasons, real estate investing should be taught in high schools so that students can start building their wealth early on.\n\n4 Finally, think of the owner's mindset versus the renter's mindset. You take pride in what you own compared to the mentality that this is someone else's problem with what you rent. Imagine if all teens had the ownership mindset where they took an ownership interest in their community and the people in it.\n\nIn some cases, parents may feel that their teens are not ready for that type of responsibility, but I beg to differ, and I also believe the world begs to differ. We've asked our teens to take ownership of their education and mental well-being during COVID. We've asked them to manage their time between school and work, and deal with the pressures of getting into college. So why can't they understand the basics of real estate and take a vested interest in building and owning a piece of their community?\n\nAm I saying for a 16-year-old to go out and buy a house tomorrow? No, but I am saying that giving them the knowledge and tools to do so is the right thing to do. Our responsibility is to set them up for true success by allowing them to develop an owner's mindset—ownership of their community, financial future, and well-being.\n\nLike teen athletes who practice and play to earn a college scholarship or achieve the dreams of becoming a pro athlete, why aren't we treating ownership of our basic needs the same way? Why aren't our teens learning and practicing the skills of communication, financial literacy, researching, community building, and most importantly, the ownership mindset?\n\nI will finish with this. I went to college with a young man who, at 18, bought his first house, which he rented out to other college students. By the time he graduated, he had owned six properties and a small apartment building. Let's say his focus after graduation was not on looking for a job but on looking for his next property and building a business that provided jobs. This could be your teen, but it has to start early. More importantly, it has to start now.\n\nSo, I ask the question again, why isn't real estate investing taught in schools? I think it is time.\n\n\nDo you want your teen to own their own home one day or know how to build generational wealth through real estate?\n\nSign them up for a Free real estate investing workshop for Teens,  where they learn by doing, gain on-the-job experience, and develop the skills needed to succeed in real estate investing, life, college, and beyond.\n\nIs your teen ready to learn Real Estate Investing?\nLEARN MORE →\nComments (0)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\n7 Reasons Why You Should Learn Marketing as a Teenager\nWhy learning Real Estate as a Teenager can be a key for Success.\nHave questions?

For more information about the transfer of Personal Information to the United States, please refer to the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Transfers of Personal Information to the United States.” To the extent your Personal Information contains details of your race or ethnic origin or physical or mental health or condition, you expressly consent to the collection, storage, and processing of this information for the purposes of your job application.\n\n \n\n \n\nHOW TO OPT OUT OF FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS\n\n \n\nIf you do not want us to contact you with marketing communications or other information regarding our products and services (or if you agreed to be contacted for such purposes at the point Personal Information was collected by us but you no longer wish to be contacted or have your information used in such way), you can let us know by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also unsubscribe at any time by contacting us at no.marketing@247teach.org. \n\nPlease note that if you have registered an account on the Site or Services or are registered for a Course, opting out of receiving marketing messages will not apply to Personal Information provided to us as a result of signing up to use our Site or Services, and we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account, your registration, and your use of the Site and Services, such as messages relating to account management, customer service, and system maintenance. These transactional account messages will thus be unaffected if you choose to opt out of marketing communications.  \n\n \n\nHOW 24/7 Education MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION\n\nVendors and Third-Party Service Providers: We may share any information we receive, including your Personal Information, with vendors or service providers, including Instructors, retained in connection with the provision of the Site or Services.

These organizations (which may include third-party suppliers, agents, subcontractors, and/or other affiliates) will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their support functions. In addition, where necessary, we have entered into Data Processing Agreements or service provider agreements with these third-party service providers, which require the service providers to both keep that information confidential and not use it for any purpose except to the extent necessary to perform their support functions.\n\nPayment Transactions: All payment transactions are conducted through our PCI-compliant secure payment solutions provider Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.

Information that you supply to our payment solutions provider is not stored by us or within our control and is subject to our payment solutions provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.\n\nEnterprise and Partnership Agreements: If you access and use the Platform or any of the other Services in connection with an Enterprise Agreement or other agreement between 24/7  and a third-party with whom we partner to provide you the Services, we may share your Personal Information with your Employer or our partner in accordance with the terms of that Enterprise Agreement or partnership agreement, as applicable.

The use of information by such organizations will be governed by their privacy policies. \n\nEvents and Partnerships: From time to time, we may partner with other organizations to run events. If you register for an event on our Site and we indicate on our Site that the event is in partnership with or sponsored by another organization, in circumstances where either you agreed to be contacted by marketing communications at the time we collected your information or where we are otherwise permitted by local law to contact you for marketing purposes, your email address may be available to that organization and you may receive emails from them after the event. Please refer to that organization’s privacy policy for information on how to opt out of their communications should you receive an email from them but no longer wish to be contacted by them.\n\nDisplaying to Other Users: Some content that you post to the Site or Services may be displayed publicly. Other users of the Site or Services may be able to see some information about you, such as information contained in comments posted in a chat room or on a blog post. You should exercise caution when using public forums. We discourage the posting of sensitive or Personal Information in comments or posts to the Site and/or Services, and we are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information by third parties that you publicly post on the Site or Services. If you participate in a course, class, workshop, or event that is recorded and you appear in the recording, your image may be visible to other participants of that course, class, workshop, or event. \n\nSocial Networking and Other Websites: The Site or Services may allow you to post information to social networking websites. We do not share your information with such social networking websites unless you direct the Site or Services to share it. The use of the information by such social networking websites will be governed by their privacy policies, and we do not control their use of the shared data. \n\nAs Required by Law and Similar Disclosures: We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, usage information and device identifier (including IP address), and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law enforcement requests and legal processes, such as a court order, warrant or subpoena; respond to your requests; enforce our policies related to our Site or Services, or other applicable policies; or protect yours, ours, or others' rights, property, or safety. Unless prohibited by law or court order, or unless we determine in our sole discretion that notification is inappropriate under the circumstances, we will take all reasonable steps to notify all affected users of a legal request for information or intended disclosure prior to disclosure.\n\nMerger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information, including Personal Information, may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as one of the transferred assets as permitted by law and/or contract. We cannot control how such entities may use or disclose such information.\n\nWith Your Consent: We may also disclose your information, including your Personal Information, where you have specifically provided your consent for the disclosure. You may withdraw consent to disclosures where you have previously given specific consent by emailing us at privacy@247teach.org.\n\n \n\n \n\nSECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION\n\n \n\nWe have implemented physical, technical, and administrative measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to only those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who need to have access to such information for the operation of our business, including the operation of the Site and Services. They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\n\nAs noted above, all payment transactions are conducted through our PCI-compliant secure payment solutions provider Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. For additional information on how Braintree secures your payment card information during transmission and storage, please refer to Braintree's privacy policy located at https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.\n\nThe safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site or the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or the Services like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site or the Services.\n\nUnfortunately, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be completely secure or error-free. We cannot warrant or guarantee the security of any Personal Information transmitted to our Site or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk.\n\n \n\n \n\nCHILDREN'S PRIVACY\n\nOur Site and the Services are not intended for nor directed toward children under the age of 14, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 14 years of age. If you believe that your child under the age of 14 may have provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us at privacy@247teach.org. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected any Personal Information from children under 14, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account.\n\nEXTERNAL LINKS\n\nThe Site or Services may, from time to time, contain links to external websites. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We have no control over these third parties, and we are not responsible for the content of such websites or the privacy policies or practices of such third parties. You should carefully review the privacy policy of any such third-party website that you visit.\n\nTRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n \n\nThe Site and the Services are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that the information we collect about you, including Personal Information, will be transferred to and processed and stored in the United States. \n\nFor purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the GDPR) and any corresponding or equivalent national implementing law or regulations, if you are located in the United Kingdom, 24/7 Education, Inc., is the data controller with respect to any information collected by it in the United Kingdom.\n\nAll transfers of Personal Information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to the United States are done pursuant to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses or, when possible, the binding corporate rules of our third-party vendors, suppliers, or service providers, if applicable.  \n\n24/7 Education acknowledges that EU and Swiss authorities have invalidated the Privacy Shield, meaning that it is no longer a lawful basis that 24/7 Education can use to transfer information from the EU or Switzerland to the US. However, we continue to process personal data consistent with the Privacy Shield principles and remain certified to the program, which requires us to make the representations below.\n\n24/7 Education complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (the \"Privacy Shield Principles\") set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information. 24/7 Education has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Program and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. \n\nAs part of our participation in the U.S.-EU and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification programs, we have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield or, to file a complaint, visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\n\nEU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield practices should first contact us at pprivacy@247teach.org. All emails received will be handled by a representative of our Legal Department. For more information on the dispute resolution process, please contact us at privacy@247teach.org. As explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means.\n\n24/7 Education is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In certain situations, 24/7 Education, Inc. may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. \n\n24/7 Education, Inc. is responsible and remains liable for the processing of Personal Information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. 24/7 Education, Inc. complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EU, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.\n\nYou have a legal right to request the Personal Information about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information. You also have a right to correct, amend, or delete such personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.\n\nPlease see elsewhere in this Privacy Policy for more information on types of Personal Information collected, purposes for data collection, types of third parties receiving Personal Information, and purposes of disclosure to such parties and your legal rights.\n\n \n\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURES FOR SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS\n\n \n\nCalifornia\n\nYour California Privacy Rights; “Shine the Light” Law\n\nWe do not disclose Personal Information about you to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you have opted in to such a disclosure or were offered the opportunity to opt out of such a disclosure at the time you provided your Personal Information and elected not to opt out, or we are required to do so by law.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, delete, and limit sharing of Personal Information.

The terms “24/7 Education,” “we,” and “us” include 24/7 Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation, 24/7 Education Space, Limited, a United Kingdom limited company, 24/7 Education Australia Pty Ltd., an Australian proprietary limited company, 24/7 Education Space Academy Pte.

This Privacy Policy also provides you with notice about how and why your Personal Information will be used and the rights you have to access and control the use of your Personal Information.\n\n \n\nAPPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n\nBy engaging with the Site and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.\n\nFor users based in the EU and the UK, we are required to describe our role and our responsibility for Personal Information.\n\nIf you access and use the Site and/or the Services in your individual capacity, we are the “data controller” under EU privacy law.\n\n \n\nIf you access and use the Platform or any of the other Services in connection with an agreement entered into between your former, current, or  prospective employer (referred to herein as “Employer”) and 24/7 Education (the “Enterprise Agreement”), and in accordance with that Enterprise Agreement, your Employer remains the data controller for certain Personal Information you may be required to disclose in connection with your use of the Platform or other Services, the terms of that Enterprise Agreement shall apply with respect to the processing of the Personal Information set forth therein. In these instances, we act as a “data processor” under EU privacy law, meaning that we process your Personal Information to provide a service to your Employer and do so at their direction. If you have any questions about specific privacy practices in connection with your use of the Platform or other Services through your Employer, please contact your Employer.\n\n \n\nIf you access and use the Platform or other Services in connection with an Enterprise Agreement entered into between your Employer and 24/7 Education, or any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate thereof, and in accordance with that agreement, your Employer is not designated as the data controller with respect to any of your Personal Information, 24/7 Education will be the data controller.\n\n \n\nBy using the Site or the Services, you are authorizing us to gather and retain data related to the provision of the Site and Services in accordance with our Terms of Service.

A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to our Site or Services and will last for longer. Some cookies are necessary to enable you to move around the Site and use the Services, such as accessing the secure areas of the Site, and they enable us to provide you with the Services you have requested. “Performance cookies” collect aggregated, anonymous, statistical information on how visitors use our Site and Services. We use this information to make improvements to the Site and our Services and to enhance your overall experience. Other cookies, called “functionality cookies,” allow the Site and Services to remember choices you make, such as your user name when you log in to your account or the language or region you are in. They may also be used to help you watch a video or comment on a blog and are intended to improve your online experience.\n\nWe and our third-party vendors and service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our Site as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a \"market segment.\" This information is then used by us and our third-party vendors and service providers to serve interest-based advertisements when you visit our Site and other websites, and our third-party vendors and service providers will combine it with other information from your visits to other websites and apps to learn more about your interests. For more information about this type of interest-based advertising and about how to opt-out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks, please visit the consumer opt-out pages of the following industry organizations: the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative. Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests. Exercising these options will not prevent other companies from displaying personalized ads to you. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.\n\n“Do Not Track” Signals. Some web browsers may transmit \"do not track\" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is currently no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Therefore, our Site, like many others, may not respond to “do not track” signals.\n\nWe also use Google Analytics Advertising Features including Google Analytics Remarketing to advertise across websites, Demographics and Interest Reporting, and AdWords and AdSense integrations to collect data about our Site traffic via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. We do not facilitate the merging of personal information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected through any Google advertising product. Google may serve ads across other websites that you visit based upon your past visits to our Site, and may also serve our advertisements on other websites. Site visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ad Settings found at https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en.

Click below.\n3 Design Methodologies Instructional Designers Must Know to be Great!\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nMastering Instructional Design, Action Mapping, and Learning Experience Design: A Comprehensive Guide to Elevating Your Design Skills\nIntroduction\n\nAs an instructional designer, you are no stranger to the constantly evolving landscape of the learning and development industry. To stay ahead of the curve and create truly impactful learning experiences, it is essential to master various design principles and methodologies. In this post, we will explore the differences between instructional design, action mapping, and Learning Experience Design (LXD) and discuss why mastering these three design principles can make you a more sizeable and effective instructional designer.\n\nUnderstanding the Differences: Instructional Design, Action Mapping, and LXD\n\n1. Instructional Design\n\nInstructional design is the systematic process of creating, developing, and delivering educational and training materials to meet specific learning objectives. It involves the analysis of learners' needs, the establishment of clear goals, the design and development of learning experiences, and the evaluation of their effectiveness. Instructional design principles provide a solid foundation for creating impactful learning experiences, but they may not always address the specific challenges faced by organizations or the individual needs of learners.\n\nKey Components of Instructional Design:\n\nNeeds analysis\n\nLearning objectives\n\nContent organization and sequencing\n\nInstructional strategies\n\nAssessment and evaluation\n\n2. Action Mapping\n\nAction mapping is a problem-solving approach to instructional design that focuses on creating learning experiences that directly address performance gaps and drive real-world impact. It involves identifying the performance gaps, defining the learning objectives, and designing learning activities that align with the desired outcomes. Action mapping ensures that the learning experiences are closely tied to the organizational goals and the specific needs of the learners.\n\nKey Components of Action Mapping:\n\nPerformance gap analysis\n\nGoal-oriented learning objectives\n\nDesigning learning activities that align with desired outcomes\n\nReal-world application and impact\n\n3. Learning Experience Design (LXD)\n\nLearning Experience Design (LXD) is an interdisciplinary approach to instructional design that focuses on creating meaningful, engaging, and enjoyable learning experiences. LXD considers the entire learning journey, from the learners' initial interactions with the content to the application of the learned skills and knowledge in real-life situations. LXD involves several key principles, including learner-centered design, emotional engagement, interactivity, feedback, and iterative design.\n\nKey Components of LXD:\n\nLearner-centered design\n\nEmotional engagement\n\nInteractivity\n\nFeedback and assessment\n\nIterative design\n\nWhy Mastering All Three Design Principles is Crucial\n\n1. Comprehensive Skillset\n\nBy mastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD, you will be equipped with a comprehensive skillset that allows you to tackle various learning challenges and create impactful learning experiences. Each methodology offers unique benefits and insights, and the ability to combine and apply these principles will make you a more versatile and effective instructional designer.\n\n2. Addressing Diverse Learning Needs\n\nEach organization and learner group has its unique set of challenges and needs. By mastering all three design principles, you can create learning experiences that cater to the specific requirements of your target audience, ensuring maximum impact and relevance. This will also help you to adapt to different industries and contexts, making you a more valuable asset to any organization.\n\n3. Aligning Learning Experiences with Organizational Goals\n\nAs an instructional designer, your ultimate goal is to create learning experiences that drive organizational success. By mastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD, you can ensure that your learning solutions are closely aligned with the organization's goals, addressing performance gaps and driving real-world impact.\n\n4. Continuous Improvement and Innovation\n\nThe learning and development industry is constantly evolving, and to stay relevant and effective, instructional designers must continuously hone their skills and adapt to new trends and methodologies. By mastering these three design principles, you will be well-equipped to embrace innovation and implement cutting-edge solutions that set you apart from your peers.\n\n5. Holistic Approach to Learning Design\n\nMastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD allows you to adopt a holistic approach to learning design. This comprehensive perspective helps you to consider all aspects of the learning journey, from content delivery and learner engagement to real-world application and assessment. This holistic approach ensures that your learning solutions are not only informative but also engaging, relevant, and impactful.\n\n6. Enhanced Learner Experience\n\nBy combining the strengths of instructional design, action mapping, and LXD, you can create learning experiences that address not only the cognitive aspects of learning but also the emotional and experiential dimensions. This results in a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience that leads to better knowledge retention and skill development.\n\n7. Competitive Edge in the Job Market\n\nAs the demand for skilled instructional designers continues to grow, mastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD can give you a competitive edge in the job market. Employers are increasingly seeking professionals who can create comprehensive learning experiences that not only address the content but also engage learners on an emotional level and drive real-world impact. By showcasing your expertise in these three design principles, you will be more likely to land higher-level positions and advance in your career.\n\n8. Adapting to Changing Learning Landscapes\n\nThe learning landscape is continuously changing, with new technologies and trends emerging at a rapid pace. Mastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD equips you with the ability to stay ahead of these changes and adapt your learning solutions to the evolving needs of organizations and learners. This adaptability is essential for staying relevant and effective in the ever-changing world of learning and development.\n\n9. Collaborating with Multidisciplinary Teams\n\nMastering these three design principles also enables you to collaborate more effectively with multidisciplinary teams, including subject matter experts, graphic designers, developers, and project managers. Your comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of learning design allows you to communicate more effectively with team members, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal. This collaboration is crucial for creating high-quality learning experiences that meet the needs of both the organization and the learners.\n\n10. Cultivating a Growth Mindset\n\nFinally, by committing to mastering instructional design, action mapping, and LXD, you are cultivating a growth mindset that values continuous learning and improvement. This mindset is not only beneficial for your professional development but also for your personal growth. Embracing this attitude of constant learning and adaptation will help you to overcome challenges, seize opportunities, and achieve success in all areas of your life.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe journey to becoming a great instructional designer is one of constant growth, learning, and adaptation. By mastering instructional design, action mapping, and Learning Experience Design (LXD), you will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to create truly impactful learning experiences that meet the diverse needs of organizations and learners.

    "title": "Teen Social Skills 101: A Guide to Surviving the Most Awkward Time of Your Life — 24/7 Teach",
    "url": "https://247teach.org/blog/2019/5/23/teen-social-skills-101",
    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENS\nMEGA FOR TEENS\nFOR ADULTS\nMEGA FOR ADULTS\nFOR ORGANIZATIONS\nMEGA FOR ORGANIZATIONS\nNEWS & FREE RESOURCES\nMEGA FOR NEWS\nABOUT US\nTeen Social Skills 101: A Guide to Surviving the Most Awkward Time of Your Life\n\nThe other day, I was looking through my old yearbooks and remembering my teenage years. As a teen, I often wondered how to make my life easier. Now, as a college student, I realize all I needed was self-confidence. If confidence is the key to conquering teen life, then social skills are the key to becoming self-confident. Our schools do a good job of academically preparing us. But our schools don’t always teach us the social skills we need to cope with real life problems. We’re taught how to be productive individuals, but not necessarily healthy human beings. If you’re dealing with low self-esteem, fear no more. Here’s your ultimate guide to survive those awkward teen moments:\n\nAwkward Moment #1: Peer Pressure\n\nThe desire to fit in can place you in risky situations and bring you a lot of trouble. You might experience peer pressure from a stranger, your crush, and sometimes even from your best friends. The worst part about is that you’re probably doing something illegal. Many teens are influenced to try drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. Some are pressured to get tattoos or piercings. Others are pressured to text inappropriate photos of themselves or to steal from a store. Peer pressure is all about doing something you don’t want to do.  \n\n Social Skill: Giving into peer pressure does not make you cool or popular—it just makes you a follower. But being a good influence earns you respect and makes you a leader. Mastering leadership will help you combat peer pressure with confidence. When you guide others to do the right thing, you instantly become a positive role model. Leaders dare to be different and aren’t afraid to stand apart from the crowd. Become someone your peers can admire by having strong principles and values others can’t break. Be firm in your decisions and don’t do anything you’re uncomfortable with. Many people became famous leaders in history by resisting peer pressure and having the courage to say “no.”\n\n \nAwkward Moment #2: Stage Fright\n\nStage fright—or performance anxiety—can make you feel like a bug under a microscope. You might experience stomach-turning twists, a cold-sweat breakout, or the need to quickly escape a room. Stage fright can happen when you need to present in front of your classmates, when your teacher chooses you to answer a question, or when you have to schedule appointments over the phone. But stage fright also occurs during nonverbal activities, like competing in a sport or simply walking into the school cafeteria. The result is the same. You feel all of the world’s eyes are on you—waiting for you to make a mistake.\n\n Social Skill: As scary as it might sound, stage fright can only be overcome through more practice with public speaking. Mastering public speaking will not only help you with verbal situations, but also with physical ones that require confident body language. Before performing, take a deep breath, smile, and concentrate on reaching your goal. The key to public speaking is preparation, good posture, proper voice modulation, and being yourself. Start off with baby steps by practicing with your friends or family. The next time you feel embarrassed, remember that the focus of public speaking is always on the audience—not on you. Your audience is rooting for you—not judging you.\n\n  \n\nAwkward Moment #3: Heartbreak\n\nRelationships can take a huge toll on a teen’s well-being. Romance and falling in love are often rollercoaster experiences with sharp ups and downs. It’s not uncommon for teens to quickly get in and out of relationships. For some, it’s no big deal. But for others, the impact of a break-up can be devastating. Heartbreak isn’t always about a boyfriend or girlfriend. You might also suffer from the end of a close friendship or the death of a loved one. Regardless of the circumstances, heartbreaks can lead to dangerous outcomes such as depression or self-harm.\n\nSocial Skill: Embracing adaptability will help you bounce back from any type of heartbreak with confidence. Being adaptable means being able to roll with the punches and accept change for what it is. Staying stuck on ended relationships can destroy you. An adaptable person will know how to let go of harmful feelings and move on with optimism. The key to adaptability is learning how to view situations with neutrality. Don’t take change personally. Become self-aware of when the intensity of your feelings doesn’t match up to the reality of the situation.\n\n \nAwkward Moment #4: Academic Breakdown\n\nA teen’s schedule is always busy. You might be juggling school, sports, extracurricular activities, family, friends, a part-time job, and a relationship all at the same time. You’re trying to get good grades while dealing with a lot of social drama. Add to this the high expectations your parents, teachers, and society have for you—and the stress of keeping up can lead you to a nervous breakdown. Teens often feel that they’re in a competition against their classmates and even against time. The burden of being the best can quickly drown you into a pool of anxiety.  \n\nSocial Skill: Using time management, goal-setting, and organizational skills will help you tackle your academic life with confidence. Learn to prioritize the most important activities in your schedule. Eliminate procrastination from your habits. Set your goals into small, measurable steps and give yourself credit each time you accomplish one. Instead of always trying to be No.1—focus on your efforts and improvements—not on perfection. Your mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures. Manage your test anxiety and remember to take breaks to avoid study burnout.  \n\n  \n\nAwkward Moment #5: Catfishing\n\nSocial media such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter have become necessary parts of a teen’s routine. On its own, social media is not a bad thing. It’s a way for teens to keep up with friends, family, and the world. But when used for the wrong reasons—social media can become a double-edged sword. Catfishing is a slang term for the act of setting up a fake personal profile on social media as a tool of deception. You might have been catfished if you were tricked into an online relationship or trolled by a false identity. Teens are especially vulnerable to online predators who use false information for sinister motives.     \n\nSocial Skill: Safe social networking skills will help you avoid the dangerous facets of social media with confidence. It’s important to practice common sense and be aware of stranger-danger online. Don’t treat social media like a dating site and always make your profile settings private. Be careful of who you befriend. If someone looks too good to be true, it’s probably because they’re not real. Profiles with only one photo, few followers or friends, and with little to no activity are usually fake. Investigate everything and block any suspicious users if necessary. Never agree to meet with a stranger, alone. \n\n \n\nAwkward Moment #6: Bullying\n\nBullying can take place in many forms—it can be verbal, physical, or cyber. Sometimes it’s even social. Did you know spreading rumors about someone is considered bullying? Getting others to socially exclude someone, in person or online, is another form of bullying. Emotions such as anger, fear, and jealousy are usually at the root of these hurtful acts. These emotions can later lead to more serious problems like violence or suicidal thoughts. So, whether you’re the abuser or the victim—it’s important to know how to stop this nasty situation.\n\n \n\nSocial Skill: Assertiveness, empathy, and conflict resolution will help you overcome both offline and online bullying with confidence. Assertive teens are neither passive nor aggressive. They defend themselves in a respectful manner without the use of violence. Speak up when you don’t like the way you’re being treated and know when to ask for help. Learn to be aware of others’ thoughts and feelings. Place yourself in their shoes. The key to peaceful conflict resolution is being able to ask questions, listen to others’ opinions, and express your own needs and wants with honesty. \n\nAwkward Moment #7: Body Image\n\n Teens go through various changes with their appearance that can make it difficult for them to feel confident. A combination of hormonal changes, acne, and braces can all contribute to negative body image. It’s not uncommon for teens to constantly compare themselves to others and feel uncomfortable in their own skin. The media often depicts an unrealistic standard of beauty with picture-perfect people. The pressure to be “pretty” or “attractive” can lead to major physical and mental issues. Teen girls might suffer from eating disorders, while boys might become obsessed with getting more muscular.\n\nSocial Skill: Positive self-talk, self-compassion, and self-acceptance will help you adjust to your growing body with confidence. Learn to accept yourself as you are and realize that the images you see on TV, magazines, and on the internet are usually photoshopped to hide flaws. Everyone has a different body type, and this is what makes you unique. Be patient and easy with yourself as you go through these changes. Adjust your negative inner thoughts from “I’m so ugly” to more positive ones—like “I’m beautiful inside and out.” Know that you’re not the only teen struggling with body image and reach out for help if your health is in threat. \n\n \n\nAs a teen, you’re going through a lot of changes that can make your life feel like a constant war zone. But being a teen is also a once-in-a-life-time experience. It’ll soon be over, and you’ll wish you had enjoyed it more instead of focusing on trivial insecurities. Looking back, I wish someone would have told me how to be more self-confident. I was always taught how to be book-smart in school, but not exactly how to be emotionally intelligent. It’s important to seek out learning opportunities outside the traditional classroom. You can’t control what happens in life—but you can control your reaction to it. Social skills can make all the difference between having the best time of your life—or the worst. \n\nThe 24/7 Learning Academy offers teen seminars designed to support your emotional growth through social skills’ coaching. We can help you reach your highest potential with the skills not taught at school. So, what are you waiting for? Get out there and conquer your teen battles with self-confidence!

Click below: \nLesson 5: Study Techniques, Mindsets, and Final Workshop\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop.\n\nImagine you are a learner struggling to keep up with coursework. You are overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to learn and find yourself forgetting key concepts and details. Determined to improve your study habits, you enroll in a learning and studying techniques workshop. In that workshop, you learn about several excellent study techniques. \n\nYour final assignment is to choose a study technique to research and prepare to debate why you think that study technique is the best. Also, provide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nIn the last lesson, you learned about self-quizzing. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about four new study techniques and how to develop a growth mindset. You will also complete your debate assignment at the end of this lesson. \n\nReady to become a 24/7 Learning and Studying Superstar? Let’s get started.  \n\nLearning Objectives \nBy the end of this lesson, learners will be able to…\n\nUnderstand the definitions of 4 different study techniques.\n\nExplain the benefits of the study techniques.\n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading: \nTo be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat are the study techniques and mindsets that benefit our learning?\n\nHow can you apply them to your daily studying routine?\n\nLesson 5:  Study Techniques, Mindsets, and Final Workshop\nStudy Techniques\n\nActive recall: Active recall is a study technique that involves actively recalling information from memory rather than simply re-reading or reviewing the material. This approach is based on the idea that retrieval practice can help to strengthen memory traces and improve long-term retention of information.\n\nChunking: Chunking is a study technique that involves breaking down large amounts of information into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can make processing and retaining the information easier and improve the ability to retrieve and apply the knowledge in different contexts.\n\nStimulate neurogenesis: Stimulating neurogenesis refers to activities that promote the growth and development of new neurons in the brain. This can be achieved through exercise, exposure to new experiences and environments, and engaging in challenging mental activities such as learning a new language or playing a musical instrument.\n\nMnemonic device: Mnemonic devices are memory aids or techniques that can help improve information retention and retrieval. Examples include acronyms, acrostics, and visualization techniques.\n\nGrowth Mindset\n\nChoosing a growth mindset involves adopting a mindset emphasizing that abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work and effort rather than being fixed or predetermined. This can help to improve motivation, persistence, and performance in academic and personal pursuits.\n\nFinal Workshop\n\nImagine you are a learner struggling to keep up with coursework. You are overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to learn and find yourself forgetting key concepts and details. Determined to improve your study habits, you enroll in a learning and studying techniques workshop. In that workshop, you learn about several excellent study techniques. \n\nYour final assignment is to choose a study technique to research and prepare to debate. Please include: \n\nWhat is the purpose of this technique\n\nWhy do you think that study technique is the best? \n\nProvide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nInclude a counterargument (an opposing view that challenges or contradicts your argument) to your chosen study technique. Research an alternative study technique and explain why someone might argue that this technique is superior to your chosen one. \n\nThen, provide a rebuttal (explain why your chosen technique is still the best option) to this argument. \n\nStep 1: Choose a study technique.\n\nSelf-Quizzing\n\nInterleaving \n\nSpaced Practice\n\nStep 2: Review your notes and discussion answers on your chosen study technique. \n\nStep 3: Have a family member, friend, or classmate assess your debate skills using the debate rubric below. \n\nOnce they are finished, please press Submit.

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENS\nMEGA FOR TEENS\nFOR ADULTS\nMEGA FOR ADULTS\nFOR ORGANIZATIONS\nMEGA FOR ORGANIZATIONS\nNEWS & FREE RESOURCES\nMEGA FOR NEWS\nABOUT US\nFive Tips for Teachers of Students Dealing with Testing Anxiety\n\nTest·​ing Anx·​i·​ety: a form of performance anxiety that is characterized by fear, worry, tension, and even feelings of physical illness in the face of taking an exam. \n\nEp·​i·​sode: a finite period in which someone is affected by a specified illness.\n\nTenth-grade math did it for me. My school combined Algebra II and Geometry into one semester of instruction for students on the gifted track, so we had twice as much content to study over the course of eighteen weeks. There was a test or a quiz at least once a week, and I began to struggle with math for the first time. \n\nI began having episodes, although I did not yet know what that meant. My symptoms included a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. I did not know what they were or why they occurred, so my anxiety remained unchecked and slowly began to worsen. In the coming years my palms began to sweat, I felt a lump in my throat, my head began to hurt, and I had trouble breathing and calming myself down before and during tests. \n\nAccording to the American Test Anxieties Association, 34-38% of students have some degree of testing anxiety. 16-20% of these students have a more severe form of the disability. \n\nThe journey to overcoming testing anxiety can be a long and difficult one, but I believe that the attitude and mentality of the teachers involved can go a long way towards helping anxious students feel more comfortable in a testing environment. \n\nHere are my top five tips for teachers of students who struggle with testing anxiety. \n\nRemember that people react to similar situations in very different ways. \n\nDo not dismiss this as obvious. One of the biggest mistakes a teacher can make is assuming that one student shouldn’t struggle with taking a test because other students in the class didn’t struggle with that same test. But humans process information and ideas in their own unique ways. This remains true when testing. \n\nDon’t treat your student’s testing anxiety as an inconvenience to you. \n\nStudents with testing anxiety can often feel ashamed or humiliated about their condition and the accommodations they may need. It’s important that teachers’ actions do not reinforce this negative line of thinking. Never treat your student’s difficulties as a personal inconvenience to you, even if helping to ameliorate them may require extra time and consideration on your end. \n\nTeach effective study habits and test-taking practices. \n\nTest-taking is a skill that can be cultivated and refined. Oftentimes, the more prepared a student feels, the less likely they are to be anxious on test-day. \n\nEncourage your students to study in advance, especially for end-of-course assessments and assessments that cover a lot of content. Create study plans for the class that encourage preparation ahead of time. \n\nDiscourage catastrophizing. Remind your student that one test is not the end of the world. Remind them that’s okay to have a few bad grades. Remind them that it’s okay to fall down as long as they get back up again. \n\nTeach strategies for the test itself: read questions in full before attempting to answer them; skip and come back to the difficult ones; check work if time permits \n\nProvide resources for strategies such as deep breathing, guided meditation, muscle relaxation and positive self-talks. Such strategies can help students to calm down before an assessment. Allow students a couple of minutes to calm down prior to the assessment. \n\nEncourage your student to look into counseling or disability services. \n\n\t\n\nAccess to counseling resources can make a huge impact on anyone struggling with a disability. Inform your students of the resources offered by your school, such as counseling or testing accommodations. Also be sure to bring up outside counseling as a potential option. \n\nOutside counseling is especially helpful as it allows students to understand the root causes of their anxiety. Counseling can help students feel empowered to overcome their anxiety. \n\nRemember that the long-term goal is to overcome the anxiety. \n\nWhile it’s important to treat students with sensitivity, it’s also important to allow them the room to overcome their anxieties. If a student with testing anxiety is preparing for a final exam or an AP exam, offer to put them in a mock testing environment to help soothe their nerves for the real thing. Instead of shielding students from their fears, the job of an educator is to provide them with consistent exposure to those fears so that they may have the opportunity to overcome them. Such treatment will be infinitely more valuable in the long-term. \n\n\n\n\nRead more about testing anxiety: https://247learningacademy.com/blog/2019/5/23/reducing-test-anxiety-with-the-three-principles\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/the-symptoms-of-test-anxiety-2795367\n\nhttps://amtaa.org/\n\nhttps://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/jshindl/cm/Teacherpower.htm\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/tips-to-reduce-stress-3145195 \n\nhttps://unsplash.com/photos/VBe9zj-JHBs\n\nDon't forget to share this post and comment below!\nDoes your teen experience testing anxiety?\nCheck out our Teen Seminars:\nQUICK VIEW\nOvercoming Testing Anxiety for Teens\nfrom $295.95\nSeminar Options and Duration::\nSelect Seminar Options and Duration:\nSelf-Paced - Learn and Work at your own pace\n3-Week intensive - includes One on One Mentorship and Community Project\n8 Week Immersive - includes One on One Mentorship, Community Project, and Mastermind Study\nREGISTER TODAY\nPurchase our New Book:\nTeen Social Skills 101:: A Guide to Surviving the Most Awkward Time of Your Life (Education is Broken and We are Here to Fix It)\nBy Daniela Lozano\nBUY ON AMAZON\nGet the latest 24/7 News\n\nSubscribe with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nComments (1)\nNewest First\nOldest First\nNewest First\nMost Liked\nLeast Liked\nPreview POST COMMENT…\nMathias A year ago · 0 Likes\n  \n\nThanks for posting this\n\nPreview POST REPLY\n4 Major Problems With In-Person Learning During COVID-19\nWhat You Post on Social Media Today Might Hurt You Tomorrow\nHave questions?

Click below.\nLessons in Leadership: Managing Virtual Teams Through Personal Turmoil\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nLeading Virtual Instructional Design Teams Through Personal Turmoil:\n\nLeading virtual instructional design teams comes with its own set of challenges, but what happens when unexpected personal turmoil strikes? In the midst of managing an instructional design project, I found myself facing a series of disruptive life events that tested my leadership skills and resilience. In this blog post, I will share my personal journey of managing virtual teams through personal turmoil and the valuable lessons I learned along the way.\n\nThe Impact of Personal Turmoil on Virtual Team Management:\n\nPersonal turmoil can have a significant impact on virtual team dynamics. It brings challenges and distractions that can affect team morale, communication, and overall productivity. In the midst of starting an important, rapid-instructional design sprint project, a sudden emergency arose when my mother was rushed to the hospital. When she was discharged, she required closer monitoring due to being at risk for falls. Adding to the challenge, my mother's caretaker unexpectedly resigned a few days later, leading me to search for a new replacement. However, just when I thought things were settling, the new caretaker fell ill the following week.\n\nDuring my experience, the sudden health issues of my mother and the subsequent caretaker issues created additional stress and tested my focus. It was crucial to recognize and effectively address the potential impact of this situation on my leadership capability, the team’s productivity, and the success of the project. \n\nThe Importance of an Empowered #2:\n\nHaving a capable and trusted second-in-command (#2) is vital when navigating personal turmoil as a leader. Having a team member who can manage the team according to the communicated vision and lead meetings in your absence is invaluable. The #2 provides stability, continuity, and support to the team, ensuring that progress is not hindered and project goals are met. An effective #2 fosters a sense of reassurance, empowers team members, and allows for seamless collaboration even during challenging times.\n\nPrior to my emergency, I had already selected and announced my #2 to the team. To ensure effectiveness, I made sure my #2 understood the team's objectives, expectations, and operational procedures clearly to ensure workflow. Because my #2 was entrusted with the responsibilities of managing the team. Together, we also discussed the vision and milestones of the project and evaluated how tasks aligned with our objectives. \n\nAs a result of this preparation, my #2 was set up for success prior to my emergency. This groundwork not only provided a sense of reassurance for me, it also empowered that team member to take on a more significant role and grow as a leader. Moreover, the presence of a capable #2 fostered a sense of stability and continuity within the team. Team members knew they had someone they could turn to for guidance and support. This enabled a smoother workflow and prevented any significant disruptions in the team's progress.\n\nLeveraging Technology, Tools, and Systems for Virtual Team Management:\n\nAlthough I delegated more responsibility to my #2, I was still the one responsible for the outcome of the project. I needed to be able to communicate with my supervisor our project status at any stage. Therefore, I needed to be constantly aware of the progress at every stage and be available for questions or redirection. In managing a virtual team during this challenging time, technology and tools became my lifeline. \n\nProject management platforms, such as Monday.com, allowed me to streamline task communication, documentation, and progress updates. At any given time, I could check our Monday project and know what was done and ready for review without having to constantly ask my #2, “How’s it coming?” We also shared Cloud documents that made it possible to view and evaluate completed tasks asynchronously. Additionally, establishing an additional channel of communication, like Slack, proved invaluable for sharing ideas, asking questions, and staying connected with the team. These tools were available as mobile apps, and they provided the necessary infrastructure to effectively manage the team, regardless of my physical location, and virtually eliminated the need for status update meetings.\n\nWhile the project management and communication platforms were essential for success, they would have been ineffective if I had not established communication and documentation systems. I provided clear expectations for when, where, and how to communicate. And I emphasized the importance of timely and transparent communication. Regular updates, progress reports, and status checks were crucial for keeping the team informed and maintaining transparency throughout the project. This helped me communicate our progress to my supervisor and provide any necessary redirection or adjustments when needed. \n\nMaintaining Team Cohesion and Morale:\n\nFostering team cohesion and maintaining morale in a virtual setting during challenging times requires intentional effort. One powerful way to maintain team morale is to recognize achievements, both individually and collectively. Consistently seeking achievement recognition opportunities, such as celebrating milestones, acknowledging exceptional work, and expressing gratitude for the team's efforts, go a long way in boosting motivation and reinforcing a positive team culture. By setting a clear vision and providing the necessary support and resources, team members feel empowered to take ownership of their work. My ability to stay on top of project progress and team communication remotely also allowed me time to give meaningful and authentic encouragement to my #2 and the rest of the team at important milestones. \n\nRegularly recognizing and celebrating the team’s achievements not only boosts morale but also reinforces the importance of their contributions. Regularly sharing successes and giving credit where it's due not only energizes team members but also inspires them to overcome challenges together. \n\nLearning from the Experience: Reflections and Lessons:\n\nIn conclusion, managing virtual teams through difficult personal circumstances is undoubtedly challenging, but it is also an opportunity for growth and learning as a leader. By understanding the potential impact of personal turmoil on team dynamics, planning ahead, empowering your #2, leveraging technology and tools, maintaining morale, and reflecting on the lessons learned, leaders can navigate these challenging situations with greater resilience. It is crucial to embrace the challenges, adapt to the circumstances, and continue to cultivate effective leadership skills in the virtual team environment. Personal turmoil may disrupt our lives, but with the right approach and a strong foundation, we can overcome challenges, continue to grow, and emerge as stronger leaders.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nCrafting an Effective Instructional Design Portfolio: A Comprehensive Guide\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nA Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Powerful Instructional Design Portfolio:\n\nIf you're an instructional designer looking to land your dream job or secure more freelance work, you need an effective portfolio. Not just any portfolio but one that clearly demonstrates your abilities and showcases your unique approach to instructional design. This guide will walk you through the process of developing a compelling portfolio that's sure to impress potential employers or clients.\n\nProject Introduction:\n\nBegin with an introduction to your project. This should include an overview of the project, a timeline of activities, and a list of stakeholders involved. For instance, if you designed an online course for a university, detail the subject matter, the course duration, and the key people involved, such as professors, administrators, and students.\n\nYour role in the project should be clearly stated, and what you were responsible for should be highlighted. This clearly indicates your capacity in the project and the tasks you were trusted with.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nNext, outline the problem you were trying to solve and why it was significant. How did your instructional design intervention bring value? For example, if the problem was a high drop-out rate in a course, show how your instructional design intervention increased student retention.\n\nResearch and Analysis:\n\nExplaining your research process and how it guided your project is vital. Discuss how you gathered data through surveys or interviews and how this data informed your project goals. Your analysis phase could include identifying learning gaps or understanding learner behaviors.\n\nProject Goals:\n\nQuantifiable goals are essential to show the tangible impact of your work. If your project aims to achieve a specific amount of revenue, increase usage, or improve student retention, these goals should be clearly stated. Also, speak about the design process and how you ensured the project was completed on time and within budget.\n\nDesign Process:\n\nThe heart of your portfolio lies in your design process. Here, you should explain the framework you used, be it ADDIE, SAM, UVD, Agile, or another. Walking someone through your design process step-by-step is a critical skill that potential employers look for.\n\nLearning Techniques:\n\nThen, discuss the learning techniques you used and why they were chosen. For instance, if you used project-based learning or gamification, explain why these techniques were effective for your particular project. Be specific about how these techniques were integrated into your design.\n\nDesign Principles and Learning Models:\n\nProvide insight into the design principles and learning models you applied. This could range from principles of adult learning to multimedia learning theories. Discussing these principles and models will showcase your theoretical grounding and ability to apply them in practice.\n\nLearnings and Next Steps:\n\nReflect on what you learned from the project. This could be insights gained from evaluations, surveys, or learner feedback. Show how you used this information to improve the learning experience. Detail any next steps for the project based on these findings.\n\nTools Used:\n\nDetail the authoring tools you used, emphasizing your flexibility across different tools. Whether you worked with corporate e-learning tools or higher education LMS like Blackboard, Canva, or Eduflow, show you can adapt to other technologies.\n\nWireframing, Storyboarding, Course Map:\n\nShow your ability to map a course by including wireframes, storyboards, or course maps. This will demonstrate your ability to plan and design the learner's journey.\n\nGraphics and Video:\n\nInclude examples of graphics and videos you've created. This showcases your multimedia design skills and your ability to create engaging, interactive content.\n\nWebsite:\n\nConsider creating a website to house your portfolio. This keeps your work organized and helps you build brand awareness. Squarespace is an excellent platform for this, with its clean templates and functionality.\n\nReflection:\n\nFinally, reflect on your learnings from the project from an instructional design perspective. What would you do differently knowing what you know now? What new skills did you learn that will better prepare you for your next project?\n\nBuilding Your Portfolio from Scratch:\n\nThere are options if you're new to instructional design and lack content for your portfolio. Consider enrolling in an instructional design boot camp like the one offered by 24/7 Teach, or engage in a design sprint. Internships and volunteer experiences can also provide you with access to real projects used by real learners and an opportunity to work in a real design team.\n\nAdditional Portfolio Components:\n\nBeyond the core elements of your portfolio, there are additional components that can further enhance its effectiveness. These can provide a broader perspective on your skills and abilities, giving potential employers or clients a complete understanding of what you bring to the table as an instructional designer.\n\nTestimonials and References:\n\nIncorporating testimonials and references from previous clients, peers, or supervisors can enhance your portfolio's credibility. Positive feedback from those who have experienced your work firsthand can provide reassurance of your skills and abilities, setting you apart from other candidates.\n\nSamples of Learning Materials:\n\nWhile discussing your projects and experiences is crucial, potential employers or clients will also want to see concrete examples of the learning materials you have created. This could include things like lesson plans, instructional videos, interactive quizzes, or learning games. Be sure to choose samples that best represent your abilities and style as an instructional designer.\n\nCertifications and Continuing Education:\n\nShowcasing any certifications or continuing education courses you have completed can also be beneficial. This demonstrates your commitment to staying updated in the field and ensures that you are equipped with the latest best practices in instructional design.\n\nProfessional Development Activities:\n\nIf you have been involved in professional development activities like presenting at conferences, publishing research papers, or leading workshops, include these in your portfolio. These activities demonstrate your engagement with the instructional design community and commitment to contributing to the field.\n\nPersonalizing Your Portfolio:\n\nWhile showcasing your technical skills and experiences is essential, don't forget to infuse your portfolio with your personality. This can be done by sharing your instructional design philosophy, discussing your passions or interests related to the field, or even including a video introduction.\n\nRemember, your portfolio is not just a showcase of your work; it reflects who you are as an instructional designer. So, be authentic, be enthusiastic, and let your unique perspective shine through.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nCreating a robust and effective instructional design portfolio is not an overnight task. It requires careful thought, meticulous planning, and much creativity. But the effort you put into it can pay off in spades when it comes to landing your dream job or securing that perfect client. So, take the time to craft a portfolio that truly represents your skills, experiences, and passion for instructional design. And remember, your portfolio is a living document; it should grow and evolve as you do.\n\nSuppose you don’t have the content for your portfolio. In that case, I recommend the 24/7 Teach instructional design Bootcamp, 24/7 design sprint services, Internships, or volunteer experiences which provide you access to real projects used by real learners, and an opportunity to work in a real design team to understand the soft skills needed to be successful in a design project.\n\nClick here to see a few portfolios from the 24/7 Instructional Design Team.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nTraining 101: Key Performance Objectives for Effective Training and Development\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nKey Performance Objectives for Effective Training and Development:\n\nIn the realm of education, a key pillar is effective training and development. The primary goal - Empowering individuals to reach their full potential, amplifying their productivity, and in turn, driving organizational success.\n\nIf you're an instructional designer, you're no stranger to the importance of performance objectives. From crafting measurable goals to ensuring the training meets the organization's specific needs, effective training and development require an accurate understanding of performance objectives. Here, we'll dive deep into the key performance objectives that instructional designers need to consider and revisit the bedrock principles of training and development—Training 101.\n\nTraining 101: Decoding the Training and Development Objectives:\n\nIn a nutshell, the primary objectives of training and development include improving productivity, enhancing efficiency, elevating employee morale, reducing onboarding time, increasing adaptability to change, minimizing errors, and decreasing employee turnover. Let's take a closer look at these objectives:\n\nBoosting productivity: The ultimate goal of any training program is to enhance employees' skills, enabling them to excel in their roles and, consequently, increase productivity.\n\nEnhancing efficiency: Training can help employees accomplish more with less by equipping them with the know-how to optimize resources and streamline processes.\n\nElevating morale: A comprehensive training program signals an organization's investment in its employees, leading to improved job satisfaction, morale, and overall work quality.\n\nReducing onboarding time: An effective training and development program can accelerate the onboarding process, enabling new employees to quickly acclimate to their roles and the organization.\n\nIncreasing adaptability: Change is the only constant in the business world. A robust training program helps employees adapt swiftly and efficiently to new technologies, processes, or strategies.\n\nMinimizing errors: By providing clear guidelines and best practices, training can significantly reduce the likelihood of errors, leading to improved outcomes.\n\nDecreasing turnover: Career development opportunities and enriching training contribute to higher job satisfaction and employee retention.\n\nSelecting the Right Training Techniques:\n\nOnce you've pinpointed your objectives, the next step is to decide which training methods align best with your goals. Blending different methods often proves effective; examples include job shadowing, coaching, book learning, or role-playing exercises. For smoother onboarding, stick to a select few techniques and maintain consistency. Establish a regular program to regularly evaluate its success in achieving the set objectives.\n\nAchieving Your Training and Development Goals:\n\nWhen developing your training and development program, keep your eyes on your ultimate goal—driving organizational success through empowered employees. These performance objectives serve as your compass, guiding you towards creating impactful, results-oriented training. Remember, an effective training program is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but a tailored strategy that meets the unique needs of your organization and its employees. It's about instilling knowledge, boosting confidence, fostering a positive work culture, and ultimately, achieving business success.\n\nGoing the Extra Mile: Training for Future Success:\n\nA future-oriented training program not only equips employees with the necessary skills for their current roles, but it also prepares them for the future. By predicting future skill demands and market trends, instructional designers can craft training and development programs that offer lasting benefits.\n\nFostering Leadership Skills: Every organization needs capable leaders. By including leadership training in your program, you are preparing your employees for future leadership roles within the organization. This includes not just technical expertise, but also emotional intelligence, decision-making abilities, and strategic planning skills.\n\nEnhancing Digital Literacy: The digital revolution has made technology an integral part of every job role. Equip your employees with the necessary technical skills, ranging from basic computer literacy to the ability to navigate complex digital tools.\n\nPromoting a Culture of Lifelong Learning: Foster a culture of continuous learning within your organization. Encourage employees to stay updated with the latest developments in their field and to continually acquire new skills. This not only aids personal development but also ensures that the organization stays competitive in the market.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluating Performance:\n\nA crucial part of any training and development program is the monitoring and evaluation stage. This involves assessing whether the program meets the set objectives, and if not, identifying areas for improvement. Various evaluation methods can be used, such as surveys, tests, and feedback sessions.\n\nRemember, evaluation is not a one-time task. Regular monitoring allows you to track progress, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that your training program remains effective over time.\n\nCommunication is Key:\n\nLastly, clear communication plays a crucial role in the success of any training and development program. Instructional designers must communicate the objectives of the training to participants effectively, ensuring that they understand what they are expected to learn and how it will benefit them.\n\nEffective communication also involves providing regular feedback to participants, celebrating their achievements, and addressing any concerns they may have. This creates an open and supportive learning environment, which is key to the success of any training program.\n\nIn conclusion, training and development is not a static process but a dynamic one that evolves according to the needs of the organization and its employees. By keeping in mind the objectives of training and using effective methods, instructional designers can create impactful programs that drive both individual and organizational success. Remember, the ultimate goal is to create a workforce that is competent, confident, and capable of steering the organization towards its strategic goals.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nCompleting the FAFSA and Accessing Scholarships: A Comprehensive Guide for Parents and Teens\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nCompleting the FAFSA and Accessing Scholarships: A Comprehensive Guide for Parents and Teens:\n\nNavigating the world of financial aid can be overwhelming, especially if you’re a parent or a teen making your initial foray into the college admissions process. However, fear not; I am here to guide you through the process. As an experienced college counselor, I have worked with countless families to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and access scholarships, enabling their dreams of higher education.\n\nI. Understanding FAFSA and Why It's Important\n\nBefore delving into the specifics, let's first understand what FAFSA is. FAFSA is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. It's the primary form that the federal government, states, and colleges use to award grants, scholarships, work-study, and loans. Filling out the FAFSA should be one of your first steps in the quest for financial aid. Even if you think you may not be eligible for need-based aid, fill out the FAFSA anyway. Many schools use it for awarding non-need-based aid.\n\nII. Preparing to Fill Out the FAFSA\n\nBefore filling out the FAFSA, you'll need to gather some documents and information. Here's what you'll need:\n\nYour Social Security Number (and your parents if you're a dependent student).\n\nYour driver's license (if you have one).\n\nYour tax records.\n\nRecords of your untaxed income, such as child support received or payments to tax-deferred pension and savings plans.\n\nRecords of your assets, such as bank account balances, investments, and real estate (but not the home in which you live).\n\nAn FSA ID to sign the form electronically.\n\nIII. Completing the FAFSA\n\nFAFSA can be completed online, which is the easiest and fastest way. Let's break down the steps:\n\nStart at FAFSA.gov: Navigate to the FAFSA website and click on the \"Start A New FAFSA\" button. You'll be asked to provide some basic identification information and choose a password.\n\nCreate an FSA ID: An FSA ID gives you access to Federal Student Aid's online systems and can serve as your legal signature. If you're a dependent student, you and your parent will need an FSA ID.\n\nFill Out Student Information: This section asks for basic information about you: your name, date of birth, etc. This section should be relatively straightforward if you have the necessary information on hand.\n\nChoose Schools: You'll need to select which schools you want your FAFSA information sent to. You can list up to 10 schools.\n\nDependency Status: This section determines whether you're considered dependent on your parents for financial aid purposes. If you're considered dependent, you'll need to provide your parents' financial information. If you're independent, you'll only need to provide your own.\n\nEnter Financial Information: This is the section where you'll input your (and possibly your parents') financial information. You can use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to pull in your tax information directly from the IRS, which can simplify this step.\n\nSign and Submit: After you've entered all the necessary information, you'll use your FSA ID to sign and submit the form.\n\nIV. After Submitting the FAFSA\n\nAfter you submit your FAFSA, you'll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR), summarizing the information you provided on your FAFSA. Review this document carefully to ensure all the information is correct. If you need to make corrections, you can log in to your FAFSA and make the necessary changes.\n\nWithin a few weeks, you'll receive financial aid award letters from the schools you listed on your FAFSA, detailing the aid they're offering you.\n\nV. Accessing Scholarships\n\nWhile the FAFSA is crucial to securing financial aid, don't overlook scholarships. Scholarships can drastically reduce the financial burden of college; unlike loans, they don't have to be repaid.\n\nStart Early: Start your scholarship search early. Some scholarships have deadlines in the fall, so don't wait until the spring of your senior year to start looking.\n\nUse Scholarship Search Engines: There are numerous online scholarship search engines that can help you find scholarships for which you might be eligible. Some reputable ones include Fastweb, Cappex, and Chegg Scholarships.\n\nCheck with Your School and Community: Many high schools, local businesses, and community organizations offer scholarships. Be sure to ask your school counselor and check local community postings.\n\nApply, Apply, Apply: The more scholarships you apply for, the greater your chances of securing one. Yes, it can be time-consuming, but the potential financial payoff is well worth it.\n\nSecuring financial aid can be complex, but it's manageable with careful planning, accurate information, and a little persistence. Filling out the FAFSA and applying for scholarships are important steps toward securing your future. Remember, investing time now can result in substantial savings in the long run, making your dreams of higher education an affordable reality.\n\nWhile navigating the world of financial aid, it's important to understand the different types of aid available.\n\nGrants are a form of financial aid that does not have to be repaid unless, for example, you withdraw from school and you owe a refund. Examples include the Federal Pell Grant, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant.\n\nScholarships are also free money that does not need to be repaid and are often based on merit, including academic, athletic, or artistic talent. They can also be awarded based on volunteer work, military affiliation, and other criteria.\nWork-study jobs are part-time jobs, either on campus or nearby, that allow students to earn money to help pay for school.\n\nLoans are borrowed money that you must repay with interest. There are two types: federal student loans, which are loaned by the government, and private student loans, which are loaned by private organizations.\n\nVII. Avoiding Common FAFSA Mistakes\n\nMistakes on the FAFSA can delay your application and potentially make you lose out on some aid. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:\n\nNot Completing the FAFSA: Many people miss out on aid because they don't complete the FAFSA. Even if you think you or your family earn too much money to qualify for aid, still fill out the FAFSA. You may be surprised by what you're eligible for.\n\nInputting Incorrect Information: Be sure to input the correct social security number and federal tax information. Triple-check these numbers for accuracy.\n\nListing Only One School: You can send your FAFSA to up to 10 schools at a time. If you're applying to more than 10 schools, you can add more later.\n\nNot Signing the FAFSA: Make sure both you and your parent (if you're a dependent) sign the FAFSA with your FSA IDs before submitting.\n\nVIII. Decoding Your Financial Aid Offer\n\nOnce you've submitted your FAFSA and received your school financial aid offers, it's time to compare them. Here's how:\n\nUnderstand Your Cost of Attendance (COA): This is the total amount it will cost you to go to that school for one year. It includes tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses.\n\nKnow Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC): This is the number used by your school to calculate how much financial aid you are eligible to receive. It's not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college.\n\nCalculate Your Need: The school determines your need by subtracting your EFC from the COA.\n\nIX. Applying for Scholarships\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into applying for scholarships. There's a scholarship for nearly everything – you just need to find the right ones for you. Here are some tips:\n\nCast a Wide Net: Don't limit yourself to local scholarships or ones with large payouts. Smaller scholarships may have less competition, and they can add up.\n\nHighlight Your Strengths: Whether it's in a personal essay or an interview, be sure to highlight your unique strengths, experiences, and aspirations.\n\nStay Organized: Keep track of the scholarships you're applying to, their requirements, and their deadlines. Missed deadlines can mean missed opportunities.\n\nProofread Your Applications: Errors can give the impression that you're not taking the scholarship seriously. Always proofread your applications and essays, and consider having a teacher, counselor, or parent review them as well.\n\nYou can unlock a world of financial aid opportunities by navigating the FAFSA, understanding the types of aid available, avoiding common mistakes, decoding financial aid offers, and applying for scholarships strategically. Remember, the process is not a sprint but a marathon, and patience and perseverance will be your best allies on this journey toward higher education.\n\nX. Tips for Scholarship Essays\n\nScholarship essays can be your ticket to financial aid. Here's how to make them shine:\n\nUnderstand the Prompt: Before you start writing, ensure you understand the essay question. Are you being asked to discuss a personal achievement, a challenge you overcame, or your future career goals? Each prompt requires a different approach.\n\nPersonalize Your Response: Use the essay as an opportunity to highlight your personality, your experiences, and your aspirations. Don't just list your accomplishments; tell a story that shows who you are.\n\nStay Focused: Stick to a single theme or point. You'll be more effective in conveying your message if you stay on topic.\n\nUse Specific Examples: Instead of vague statements, use specific examples to illustrate your points. This will make your essay more compelling and believable.\n\nProofread: Mistakes can detract from your message. Proofread your essay several times and consider asking someone else to review it too.\n\nXI. Private Student Loans\n\nYou might consider private student loans if federal aid, grants, work-study, and scholarships aren't enough to cover your education costs. These are offered by banks, credit unions, and other private lenders. Here's what you should know:\n\nInterest Rates: Unlike federal student loans, which have fixed interest rates set by the government, private loan interest rates can vary depending on your credit and the lender.\n\nRepayment Options: Private loans often have less flexible repayment options than federal loans. Be sure to understand the terms before borrowing.\n\nCredit Check: Private lenders will usually require a credit check. If you have a limited credit history, you may need a co-signer.\n\nCost: Remember that a loan is borrowed money that you must pay back with interest. Be mindful of how much you borrow and consider your potential future income.\n\nXII. Scholarships Specific to Colleges\n\nMany colleges offer scholarships to incoming students based on academic achievement, talent, or other criteria. When you're admitted to a college, ask the financial aid office about scholarship opportunities. Here's how:\n\nMerit-based Scholarships: These scholarships are based on academic, athletic, or artistic talent or other characteristics.\n\nNeed-based Scholarships: These scholarships are awarded based on financial need.\n\nCollege-specific Scholarships: These scholarships are offered by individual colleges and might be tied to a specific major or program at the school.\n\nRemember, you won't know what scholarships you might be eligible for unless you ask. Always check with the financial aid office at your college about potential scholarship opportunities.\n\nNavigating the world of financial aid can feel overwhelming, but with knowledge, organization, and a bit of persistence, you can unlock a world of opportunities. Remember, every bit of aid you receive is money you or your family won't have to pay out of pocket or borrow. Investing time now in the process can pay off significantly in the future.\n\nXIII. Scholarship Search Engines\n\nIf you're looking for additional funding options beyond federal aid and scholarships offered by individual colleges, scholarship search engines can be a valuable resource. These websites aggregate scholarships from various sources and allow you to search based on different criteria like your intended major, background, or hobbies. Some popular scholarship search engines include Fastweb, Cappex, and Chegg Scholarships. Here's how to maximize your use of these tools:\n\nCreate a Profile: You can create a personalized profile on most scholarship search engines. The more details you provide, the more customized your scholarship matches will be.\n\nBe Thorough: Include all of your hobbies, affiliations, and interests. You might be surprised by the scholarships available for diverse areas.\n\nApply Early and Often: The more scholarships you apply for, the better your chances of winning. Start your search early and apply to as many relevant scholarships as possible.\n\nXIV. State-Based Financial Aid\n\nIn addition to federal aid and private scholarships, your state government may also offer financial aid programs. These programs often include grants, scholarships, and work-study opportunities. To explore what your state offers, visit the website of your state's higher education agency. Remember:\n\nDeadlines: State financial aid deadlines may differ from federal ones, so ensure you apply on time.\n\nEligibility: Eligibility requirements may vary. Some programs may be need-based while others might be merit-based.\n\nRenewal: Some state aid programs require you to reapply each year, while others automatically renew. Be sure to understand the terms of any aid you receive.\n\nXV. Work-Study Jobs\n\nWork-study is a federal program that provides part-time jobs for students with financial need, allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. Here's what you need to know:\n\nAvailability: Not all schools participate in the federal work-study program. Check with your school's financial aid office.\n\nEarnings: Your total work-study award depends on your level of financial need, the amount of other aid you receive, and the availability of work-study funds at your school.\n\nJobs: Work-study jobs vary. They can be on campus, off campus, or even related to your course of study.\n\nConclusion:\n\nRemember, the more proactive you are in seeking out these opportunities, the more likely you are to secure the funding you need to make your college dreams a reality. Whether you're applying for federal aid, hunting for scholarships, or considering loans, staying informed, organized, and persistent is important. The road to college can be daunting, but with the right resources and dedication, it's manageable. And always remember, investing in your education is investing in your future.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nThe Supreme Court and Holistic Admissions: What's Next in College Admissions?\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nBuilding a Roadmap to Success: The Importance of High School Graduation Plans for 9th, 10th, and 11th Graders:\n\nWe often hear phrases like 'The early bird catches the worm.' This certainly applies to a vital aspect of your high school journey - crafting a comprehensive high school graduation plan. For students in the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades, designing a graduation plan tailored to your aspirations is essential for success in your academic pursuits.\n\nIt might seem premature to start thinking about colleges and majors when you're barely out of middle school, but early planning gives you a decisive advantage. You’ll better understand the requirements of your desired colleges, the prerequisites for your chosen major, potential scholarships, and other beneficial extracurricular activities. This post will help you understand the importance of a well-structured high school graduation plan.\n\nLaying the Foundation: Identifying Top Colleges\n\nChoosing your dream college can be a thrilling yet daunting task. Identifying your top three colleges early allows you to research the schools' admissions requirements thoroughly. Each university has its unique set of prerequisites - from standardized test scores and GPA to specific high school coursework. By understanding these requirements early on, you can tailor your high school journey to meet these standards, greatly increasing your chances of admission.\n\nMaking Your Mark: Understanding Admissions Requirements\n\nColleges don't just look at your grades; they are interested in the holistic picture of you as a student. Beyond your academic capabilities, they seek evidence of leadership, community involvement, and personal interests. By identifying the requirements of your chosen colleges early, you can make informed decisions about which extracurricular activities to pursue, further increasing your attractiveness as a prospective student.\n\nFueling Your Journey: Scholarships and Financial Aid\n\nCollege education can be expensive, but financial help is available in various forms - scholarships, grants, and work-study opportunities. Identifying scholarships offered by your chosen schools early on can help you plan effectively. Some scholarships have specific prerequisites such as certain GPA, community service, or specific talents. By knowing these ahead of time, you can set personal goals that align with these opportunities, reducing the financial burden of your college education.\n\nChoosing Your Path: Identifying Your Major and Prerequisites\n\nChoosing a major is a significant step in your academic journey. It can shape your career and life beyond college. Knowing the prerequisites for your desired major early can guide your course selection throughout high school. This way, you're not only preparing for college admission but also for success in your future studies.\n\nBoosting Your Credibility: Potential College Recommendations\n\nLetters of recommendation can significantly boost your college applications. Teachers, coaches, or community leaders who know you well can highlight your strengths, character, and growth. By identifying potential recommenders early, you can build stronger relationships with these individuals, leading to more meaningful and powerful letters of recommendation.\n\nPacing Yourself: Developing a Study Schedule\n\nA study schedule is a critical part of your high school graduation plan. It helps you manage your time efficiently, balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and personal life. An early understanding of your college requirements can inform your study schedule, ensuring you're adequately prepared for any standardized tests or challenging coursework.\n\nThe Bottom Line: The Power of Planning\n\nA high school graduation plan is much more than a checklist; it’s a roadmap for your future. When tailored to your goals and dreams, it can make the journey to college smoother and less stressful. By defining your target colleges, understanding their requirements and scholarships, identifying your major and prerequisites, seeking potential recommenders, and setting a study schedule, you're positioning yourself for success.\n\nGetting the Most Out of Your High School Experience\n\nIn addition to academic achievement, colleges look for well-rounded applicants who can bring diversity and enrich their campuses. Therefore, another critical part of your graduation plan involves exploring and committing to meaningful extracurricular activities. These can be sports, clubs, volunteer work, internships, or even personal projects like starting a blog or YouTube channel.\n\nIn these activities, try to find a balance between what you enjoy, what aligns with your intended major, and what may offer a leadership role. Colleges appreciate depth and commitment over scattered involvement, so it's better to focus on a few activities that you're passionate about rather than superficially participating in a multitude.\n\nThe Necessity of Flexibility\n\nWhile it's essential to have a detailed high school graduation plan, it's equally important to remember that your plan isn't set in stone. Your interests might change, unexpected opportunities may arise, and life can generally be unpredictable. Flexibility is key. Regularly revisit and revise your plan as you navigate your high school journey.\n\nBuilding Your Support System\n\nA strong support system is crucial for the journey ahead. Seek guidance from your teachers, school counselors, family, and older friends who've navigated the college admissions process. They can provide insight into course selections, college application tips, essay writing, scholarship applications, and more. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.\n\nWrapping It Up: The Power of Early Planning\n\nRemember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\n\nWith a proactive mindset and a clear plan, the process of preparing for college becomes less overwhelming and more purposeful. Early planning empowers you to make informed decisions, enabling you to align your high school experience with your college and career aspirations.\n\nStarting this journey early can also lessen the last-minute rush of senior year, allowing you to enjoy the unique moments and experiences of your final year of high school. In addition, understanding your future direction can lead to a more fulfilling high school experience overall.\n\nThe importance of a high school graduation plan cannot be overstated. Remember, the plan is your roadmap, the compass guiding you toward your future. So, start today, and unlock the door to a successful future.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nThe 90 Minute Daily Study Schedule\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nPart 1 - Mastering the Study-Life Balance: \nA Proven 90-Minute Study Schedule for the Busy Student\n\nAs an academic performance coach and college counselor, I've encountered many students who struggle to juggle their busy lives and academic commitments. The never-ending cycle of classes, homework, extra-curricular activities, and personal lives often overwhelms students. So, how can you make the most of your time and excel academically? The secret lies in having a study schedule backed by empirically effective study techniques that fit into even the busiest lives.\n\nThe Importance of a Study Schedule\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of the 90-minute study plan, let's discuss why having a study schedule is crucial. A study schedule serves as a roadmap for your academic journey. It:\n\nImproves Time Management: Knowing what to study and when eliminates the paralysis of choice and maximizes productive time.\n\nEnhances Focus: A set schedule trains your brain to enter a 'study mode,' improving concentration.\n\nRelieves Stress: Being organized can significantly reduce academic-related stress and anxiety.\n\nBoosts Retention: Scheduled revision and diversified learning improve retention and understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe 90-Minute Study Plan Explained\n\nThe 90-minute study plan aims to break down your core subjects and alternate non-core subjects into digestible daily chunks. Here's how it works:\n\nCore Classes (60 minutes)\n\nStudy 20 minutes each for your three most important core classes.\n\nMonday: Math (20 min), Science (20 min), English (20 min)\n\nTuesday: Math (20 min), Science (20 min), English (20 min)\n\n... and so on.\n\nNon-Core Classes (30 minutes)\n\nChoose two non-core subjects and alternate them every other day for 15 minutes each.\n\nExample:\n\nMonday: History (15 min), Music (15 min)\n\nTuesday: Spanish (15 min), Technology (15 min)\n\nWednesday: History (15 min), Music (15 min)\n\nThursday: Spanish (15 min), Technology (15 min)\n\n... and so on.\n\nNote-taking: Your Key to Success\n\nDuring your classes, taking effective notes is crucial. They serve as the backbone of your study sessions. Employ the Cornell Method or Mind-Mapping based on the subject matter for efficient note-taking. Use the 20-minute study sessions to revisit your notes, clarify doubts, and reinforce information.\n\nStudy Groups for Collaborative Learning (Twice a Week)\n\nActive participation in study groups at least twice a week can significantly enhance your understanding of complex subjects. These sessions encourage:\n\nPeer Teaching: Explaining a topic helps you understand it better.\n\nCollaborative Problem-Solving: Multiple perspectives can lead to better solutions.\n\nAccountability: A group setting can motivate you to stay on track.\n\nImplementing the Plan Amidst a Busy Schedule\n\nBe Consistent: Choose the same time slot every day to train your brain for 'study mode.'\n\nUse Technology: Utilize study apps for time management and note-taking.\n\nTime-Bound Breaks: For every 30-minute study session, take a 5-minute break to relax your mind.\n\nEmpirical Techniques for Successful Studying\n\nResearch suggests that active recall and spaced repetition can dramatically improve the efficiency of your studying. Active recall involves actively stimulating memory recall during the learning process. Instead of merely reading the text, quiz yourself or use flashcards to engage with the material. Spaced repetition involves reviewing and testing yourself on material over increasing intervals over time.\n\nThe Importance of Flexibility and Adaptation\n\nWhile a study schedule is crucial, it's equally important to be flexible. Sometimes, unexpected commitments or situations may arise that conflict with your scheduled study time. The key here is to adapt and compensate for the lost time at your earliest opportunity.\n\nHow to Adapt:\n\nPrioritize: If you missed studying for a core subject one day, prioritize it the next day.\n\nAdjust Timings: Couldn't make your 90-minute slot? Don't worry—try breaking it into smaller chunks throughout the day.\n\nWeekend Review: Use the weekend as a cushion for catching up or revising crucial subjects.\n\nThe Importance of Breaks and Mental Health\n\nIn our quest for academic excellence, we often neglect mental health. Short breaks, physical activity, and relaxation techniques can significantly enhance your concentration and effectiveness.\n\nImplementing Breaks:\n\nThe Pomodoro Technique: Work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This aligns perfectly with your 90-minute study plan.\n\nPhysical Activity: Incorporate short walks or stretches during your breaks.\n\nMindfulness: Practice mindfulness or short meditation sessions to clear your mind.\n\nLeveraging Technology for Success\n\nIn today's digital world, various apps can help you stick to your study schedule and manage your time more efficiently.\n\nCalendar Apps: Use Google Calendar or iCal to set reminders for your study slots.\n\nNote-taking Apps: Apps like OneNote, Apple Notes, or Evernote can be highly beneficial for maintaining digital notes.\n\nTime Management Apps: Consider using time management apps like RescueTime and Pomodoro timers to track how you spend your time on the computer.\n\nMonitor, Assess, and Revise\n\nAfter a few weeks of following your new schedule, take some time to evaluate your performance. Are you meeting your study goals? Are you scoring better on tests and assignments? If not, some adjustments may be required.\n\nMonitor: Keep track of your academic performance.\n\nAssess: Evaluate your study techniques—are they effective?\n\nRevise: Make necessary adjustments to your study schedule or methods based on your assessment.\n\nPart Two: The Art of Consistent Learning - Why Being a Tortoise Wins the Race\nThe Timeless Lesson of Consistency over Intensity\n\nWe've all heard the adage, \"Slow and steady wins the race,\" popularized by the tale of the Tortoise and the Hare. While the fable entertains kids, its message also holds a profound truth applicable to learners at all stages of life. The concept of gradual, consistent progress often outweighs any benefits gained from brief, intense efforts.\n\nThe Pitfall of Over-Commitment\n\nLet's delve into real-world examples. Suppose you were eager to become a guitar maestro. On your first day, your excitement led you to strum away for hours, only to end up with sore, blistered fingers that halted your practice for days. Similar scenarios play out for those diving headfirst into learning a new language. An initial enthusiasm leads to an intense, hour-long session of verb conjugation, making you rethink if you're cut out for language learning at all.\n\nThis phenomenon isn't rare; it's a universal experience of biting off more than one can chew. Research shows that last-minute cramming doesn't contribute to long-term retention of information. What does work is a principle known as spaced repetition or distributed practice. Here, consistent, regular revisiting content is more effective than gulping down large chunks of information in one go.\n\nConsistency: The Builder of Habits\n\nBut why is this measured approach so effective? Consistency isn't just about retention; it's a cornerstone for habit formation. Studies indicate that it takes approximately 66 days to cultivate a habit. This habit-forming process is critical in learning contexts, whether it's practicing a musical instrument, acquiring a new language, or excelling in academic subjects.\n\nJust like in the educational programs of 24/7 Teach, students are encouraged to study in small but consistent increments. This repeated exposure to study material, tailored to each student's needs, reinforces learning, ultimately making studying a habit rather than a chore.\n\nFrom Struggle to Second Nature\n\nOnce you cross the threshold of habit formation, something magical happens: the task no longer feels burdensome. For musicians, daily practice becomes an integral part of their lives; language learners find it easier to allocate time for consistent study. Similarly, students following a disciplined study schedule find the process more natural and less stressful.\n\nBe the Tortoise in Your Learning Journey\n\nSo, in your quest for educational triumph, model yourself after the tortoise rather than the hare. A well-paced, consistent learning strategy enhances retention and turns the sometimes daunting task of studying into a routine activity. By adopting this approach, you're not just paving the way for academic success but setting the stage for lifelong learning.\n\nBy instilling consistency into your 90-minute study schedule, as discussed in part one, you magnify the effectiveness of every single minute. Your study groups, note-taking, and empirical study techniques will all benefit you, shaping you into a more resilient and successful learner. So remember, whether you're aiming for scholarly achievement or mastering a new skill, be consistent; your potential is boundless.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCreating a study schedule may seem tedious, but the benefits are enormous. Even if you're balancing a hectic schedule, dedicating just 90 minutes daily to focused studying can significantly impact your academic performance and mental well-being. From effective note-taking to empirical study methods, incorporating these expert tips into your routine will set you on the path to academic success.\n\nRemember, hard work and intelligent work are the keys to a successful academic journey. Adopting effective study strategies and a well-thought-out 90-minute study schedule can be your most brilliant move yet. So make that commitment today and watch how a mere 90 minutes can radically transform your academic life.\n\nDid you know early intervention in academic challenges can make all the difference?

Click below.\nHow to Equip your Teen's for Future Financial Success: 14 Simple Steps\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWhy Financial Literacy Isn't Just for Adults: Preparing Teens for Economic Success:\n\nFinancial literacy, a term that once reverberated primarily within adult circles, is no longer a concept we can afford to introduce later in life. As a Teen Leadership Coach, I've realized that instilling financial awareness in teenagers can be a game-changer. It equips them with a pragmatic skill set crucial for their future economic success.\n\nKeywords: Financial Literacy, Teenagers, Economic Success.\n\n1. The Landscape of Modern Financial Challenges\n\nWe live in a dynamic world where economic landscapes evolve, and financial challenges mount. From student loans to credit card debts, young adults often find themselves in financial quagmires due to a lack of knowledge. Introducing financial literacy to teenagers can act as a proactive measure, equipping them to navigate these challenges adeptly.\n\n2. The Foundations of Financial Literacy\n\nFinancial literacy for teens isn't about diving deep into stock market intricacies or intricate financial tools. It's about the basics:\n\nBudgeting: Understanding the importance of living within their means.\n\nSaving: Recognizing the need to set aside a part of their allowances or earnings.\n\nInvesting: Grasping the rudiments of making their money work for them.\n\nCredit: Knowing how credit works and the implications of good and bad credit.\n\n3. Building Financial Confidence\n\nLike any other skill, the earlier it's nurtured, the more innate it becomes. By introducing financial literacy during the teen years, we're not just teaching them about money. We're fostering financial confidence, empowering them to make informed decisions that echo throughout their adult lives..\n\n4. The Domino Effect of Financial Literacy\n\nFinancial literacy does more than just teach teens about money. It introduces them to concepts like:\n\nDelayed Gratification: The idea of waiting and saving for something they want, rather than impulsively spending.\n\nRisk Assessment: Understanding the potential risks and rewards of financial decisions.\n\nCritical Thinking: Evaluating financial opportunities and pitfalls with a discerning mind.\n\n5. Digital Age and Financial Literacy\n\nToday’s teens are digital natives. With the rise of online banking, digital investments, and cryptocurrencies, understanding the digital financial realm is indispensable. By preparing teens with digital financial literacy, we're gearing them up for a world where money isn't just paper and coins.\n\n6. Combating Financial Peer Pressure\n\nIn an age of social media influencers and instant gratification, teens often face financial peer pressure. Whether it's about owning the latest gadget or wearing branded apparel, the pressure is real. Financial literacy teaches teens to differentiate between 'wants' and 'needs', helping them stand firm against such pressures.\n\n7. Preparing for Future Endeavors\n\nWhether it’s pursuing higher education, starting a business, or buying their first car, financial literacy lays the foundation. It offers teens the tools they need to approach these milestones with financial wisdom and foresight.\n\n8. Encouraging Economic Independence\n\nOne of the most empowering feelings is economic independence. When teens are equipped with financial know-how, they're better prepared to step into adulthood with confidence, reducing their reliance on parents or guardians.\n\n9. Setting the Stage for Generational Financial Wisdom\n\nWhen we teach teens about financial literacy, the knowledge doesn't stop with them. They carry these lessons into their adult lives, passing them on to the next generation, thus fostering generational financial wisdom.\n\n10. Practical Realities: Teens Earning and Learning\n\nIt’s not uncommon for teenagers to take up summer jobs, internships, or part-time roles. These opportunities offer more than just pocket money. They introduce teens to the practical realities of earning. Financial literacy ensures that they handle their earnings wisely, setting the groundwork for future financial responsibilities.\n\n11. Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice\n\nWhile many school curriculums are gradually introducing financial education, there’s a chasm between textbook knowledge and real-world application. Financial literacy programs for teens should emphasize simulations, real-life scenarios, and interactive learning. By bridging this gap, we ensure teens are not just theoretically sound but also practically proficient.\n\n12. Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit is thriving among today’s youth. Teens with innovative ideas often aspire to become future startup founders. By ingraining financial literacy, we're equipping these young aspirants with the foundational knowledge needed to manage business finances, understand investments, and navigate the economic aspects of entrepreneurship.\n\n13. Money and Mental Well-being\n\nFinancial stress is a significant contributor to mental health issues in adults. By introducing financial literacy early, we can mitigate the chances of such stressors in our teens' future. Understanding money and having the confidence to manage it can lead to a healthier mental outlook on life's challenges.\n\n14. Engaging Parents in the Journey\n\nWhile teens are the primary audience for financial literacy, parents play a pivotal role. Workshops, webinars, and collaborative sessions can engage parents, ensuring that the principles of financial literacy are reinforced at home. After all, financial education is more effective when it's a collective family endeavor.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs we continue to navigate a world marked by economic volatility and rapid digital transformations, the significance of financial literacy only intensifies. For our teens, it's more than just a life skill—it's a life shield. A shield that safeguards them from potential financial pitfalls and equips them to seize economic opportunities with both hands.\n\nBy championing the cause of financial literacy for teenagers, we're not merely preparing them for adulthood. We're setting the stage for a generation that will redefine economic success, armed with knowledge, confidence, and a proactive approach to money management.\n\nLet's remember: When we invest in our teens today, we're banking on a future rich in promise, potential, and economic prosperity.\n\nAs we wrap up this discussion on financial literacy...\n\nOur specialized Financial Literacy programs and personalized coaching sessions offer teens the tools they need to navigate the complex world of money management. We move beyond traditional textbook lessons, plunging teens into real-world financial scenarios that cultivate genuine money-management skills. This equips them to confidently tackle monetary challenges and opportunities in their future.\n\nInvest in your teen's financial future and lay the foundation for their economic success.

    "html": "We use cookies and similar technologies to run this website and help us understand how you use it.\n\nOK\nSIGN IN\nFOR TEENS\nMEGA FOR TEENS\nFOR ADULTS\nMEGA FOR ADULTS\nFOR ORGANIZATIONS\nMEGA FOR ORGANIZATIONS\nNEWS & FREE RESOURCES\nMEGA FOR NEWS\nABOUT US\n7 Reasons Why You Should Learn Marketing as a Teenager\n\nBy: Catalina Tatu\n\n24/7 Teen Marketing Superstar\n\nWhen you’re trying to make your way in the world, it can often be difficult to know where you should focus your efforts. What skills do you need most in order to get that dream job or further your career? Should you learn a new language, sharpen existing computer skills, or something else? Even if your interests lie in another subject area, marketing might be an excellent choice. Many people don’t realize this, but marketing is a great subject to study no matter what field you want to go into. Marketing will teach you how to sell yourself for college and for a job, as well as how to sell anything from cupcakes to ideas.\n\nREASON 1: GETTING INTO YOUR DREAM COLLEGE\n\nMarketing is all about sales, it’s about finding the best way entice your ideal customer into buying a product you think is perfect for them. College admissions work in the same way, your application is your marketing pitch, it’s what you’re using to try and convince your dream college to buy what you’re selling. Through learning marketing, you will improve the skills needed to convincingly market yourself to your dream college.\n\nREASON 2: DOING WELL AT A JOB INTERVIEW\n\nIn a job interview, the company is looking for the best fit for them. Marketing is all about showing that your product is the best fit for the customer, its about making them see the products value and making them believe that it’s exactly what they’ve been looking for. Applying those skills to a job interview, even for a minimum wage position at say, Starbucks, will help you to identify yourself as a stronger candidate and increase your chances of landing that job.\n\nREASON 3: INCREASING YOUR FOLLOWERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nThe digital world is where most marketers spend most of their time. Gone are the days of flyers and TV and radio advertisements, the majority of successful marketing is done through pop-ups on websites and on social media. Marketers must be intimately familiar with social media, learning the best times to post and the best places to cater their content towards. The same way that marketers apply their knowledge towards selling products, you can apply it towards increasing your follower counts and making content that’s more interacted with. If you want to go viral, or become a social media superstar, using marketing skills will help you lay a foundation to do that.\n\nREASON 4: CRAFTING CONVINCING ARGUMENTS\n\nWhile a lot of marketing is about sales and advertisements, its also about the rhetoric and minute details behind those things. Marketers must know how to craft the perfect content to draw their potential customers in, deploying skills that are often found in things such as presidential debates and TedTalks. They use rhetoric and other persuasive devices, which are skills that can be applied across almost every discipline and even can increase your chances of winning an argument against your parents or friends.\n\n\nREASON 5: LEARNING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OTHERS\n\nSuccessful marketing requires you to understand your customer, to understand their wants, to understand their needs, and to understand what would make them inclined to buy your product. Marketers need to be familiar with the human mind, they need to learn how people think and how to use that to benefit them. While that might sound rather villainous in notion, learning to read people and understand people is an important skill that can help anywhere you go in life.\n\n\nREASON 6: IMPROVING YOUR RESEARCH SKILLS\n\nIn order to market in the most successful manner possible marketers must do a lot of research. They need to know a little bit about everything in order to identify the strategies needed to make their products shine. A course in marketing is sure to improve your research skills, maybe even by leaps and bounds.\n\n\nREASON 7: CREATING A BRAND FOR YOURSELF\n\nMarketing aims to sell not just a product, but a brand. Marketers identify a brand for their products, something that sets them apart from others and makes them interesting to customers. You can use marketing skills to establish the same sort of thing for yourself, your brand will be how you want others to perceive you and can be helpful in everything previously mentioned. You can sell your brand, the uniquely you part of you, to colleges, to jobs, to your friends on social media and even to your partner in an argument. Marketing skills will allow you to establish yourself in an indisputable way, something that will aid with almost anything in your life.\n\nIn conclusion, you might be thinking, how do I get into marketing? You don’t have to commit to majoring in marketing, nor do you have to pursue a career in marketing to learn the sorts of skills associated with it. Simply taking one class can give a basis for the skills mentioned in this article. 24/7 Teach provides students with an 8-week digital marketing boot camp in which they can learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and decide whether they wish to pursue a career in the discipline or simply utilize the skills in their every day.\n\nFor more information on 24/7 Teach’s Digital Marketing Bootcamp for Teens, click below.\n\nREGISTER TODAY > BECOME A TEEN DIGITAL MARKETER →\n\nReceive a 5% Discount on your purchase of the Digital Marketing Bootcamp for Teens \n\nDon't forget to share this post and comment below!\n\nWant to know if Digital marketing is right for your Teen?\nFind out with a Free 5-day workshop.\n\n►  Learn the basics of Digital Marketing\n\n►  Discover the different roles within Digital Marketing.\n\n►  Complete a small digital marketing project and find out if  digital marketing is the right option for your Teen.\n\n   SEND ME LESSON # 1 →\n\nWe respect your privacy.

Click below.\nBreaking into Instructional Design: How to Land a Job Without Experience\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nNavigating the Instructional Design Job Market: How to Launch Your Career Without Prior Experience:\n\nAs a recruiter specializing in instructional design, I understand the challenges of securing a job in this field without prior experience. Many companies explicitly state in their job postings that they seek candidates with 3 to 5 years of experience, making it seem like a daunting task for newcomers. However, I'm here to share valuable insights and strategies to help you overcome this hurdle and prove your worth to potential employers.\n\nShowcase Transferable Skills:\n\nAlthough you may lack direct instructional design experience, highlighting transferable skills is crucial. Identify connections between your previous roles and instructional design. Skills such as project management, communication, research, writing, creativity, and critical thinking can be applied to instructional design. Emphasize these skills in your resume, cover letter, and interviews to demonstrate your adaptability and contribution to instructional design projects.\n\nDevelop a Strong Portfolio:\n\nBuilding a portfolio is essential for showcasing your instructional design abilities, particularly when you lack professional experience. Create sample projects that exemplify your instructional design skills, such as designing a training module, developing e-learning content, or creating a multimedia presentation. You can work on projects independently, collaborate with others, contribute to open-source instructional design initiatives, and now, consider completing instructional design bootcamps. These bootcamps offer intensive, focused training and hands-on experience to quickly enhance your skill set and provide you with real-world projects to include in your portfolio.\n\nGain Practical Experience through Volunteering, Internships, and Bootcamps:\n\nVolunteering your instructional design skills to non-profit organizations, educational institutions, or community initiatives can provide practical experience. Look for opportunities to contribute to instructional design projects, create training materials, or assist with curriculum development. Additionally, seek internships or entry-level positions that offer on-the-job training in instructional design. Another valuable option is completing instructional design bootcamps. These programs provide structured learning, mentorship, and hands-on projects, giving you a comprehensive understanding of the field and bolstering your resume.\n\nUnderstand Team Dynamics and Stakeholder Engagement:\n\nIn addition to technical skills, employers value candidates who can operate effectively within instructional design teams and work with various stakeholders. Familiarize yourself with the dynamics of collaborative design environments. Understand the role of instructional designers in relation to project managers, subject matter experts (SMEs), managers, and learners. Showcase your ability to work collaboratively, gather requirements, communicate effectively, and adapt to the needs of different stakeholders. This knowledge will demonstrate your understanding of the broader instructional design context and increase your appeal to employers.\n\nContinuous Learning and Professional Development:\n\nThe instructional design field is constantly evolving, with new technologies, methodologies, and trends emerging. Demonstrate your commitment to continuous learning by staying updated with industry news, research, and best practices. Attend webinars, workshops, and conferences related to instructional design. Participate in online courses or pursue certifications that provide specialized knowledge in specific areas of instructional design, such as e-learning development, multimedia design, or instructional technology. This dedication to ongoing professional development showcases your adaptability and passion for staying current in the field.\n\nNetwork with Instructional Design Professionals:\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in any job search, including instructional design. Attend industry events, join professional associations, and engage with instructional design communities online. Connect with professionals in the field through social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or instructional design forums. Building relationships with experienced instructional designers can provide valuable insights, mentorship opportunities, and potential job leads. Additionally, consider reaching out to local companies or organizations that may benefit from instructional design expertise. Expanding your network can open doors and help you tap into the hidden job market.\n\nLeverage Instructional Design Bootcamps:\n\nInstructional design bootcamps are intensive programs designed to provide comprehensive training in instructional design principles, methodologies, and tools. These bootcamps offer structured learning environments, often led by industry experts, where you can acquire essential skills and knowledge. Completing an instructional design bootcamp not only equips you with the necessary technical expertise but also provides you with tangible projects to showcase in your portfolio. Employers recognize the value of these bootcamps as they demonstrate your commitment to learning and acquiring relevant skills in a condensed timeframe.\n\nEmphasize Teamwork and Stakeholder Collaboration:\n\nInstructional designers often work as part of a team, collaborating with various stakeholders such as project managers, subject matter experts (SMEs), managers, and learners. Highlight your ability to navigate these collaborations effectively. Provide examples of situations where you successfully collaborated with teams, managed expectations, gathered requirements, and incorporated feedback from different stakeholders. Demonstrating your understanding of team dynamics and your ability to work harmoniously with diverse stakeholders will reassure employers that you can integrate seamlessly into their instructional design projects.\n\nSeek Freelance or Contract Opportunities:\n\nWhile permanent positions may be challenging to secure without experience, consider exploring freelance or contract opportunities within the instructional design field. Many organizations, including startups and small businesses, often look for short-term instructional design support. By taking on freelance or contract work, you can gain practical experience, develop a track record of successful projects, and expand your professional network. These opportunities can serve as a valuable stepping stone toward securing a full-time instructional design role.\n\nDemonstrate Adaptability and Willingness to Learn:\n\nEmployers value candidates who demonstrate adaptability and a willingness to learn. Highlight instances in your past experiences where you quickly acquired new skills, adapted to changing circumstances, or took initiative to learn independently. Showcase your ability to embrace new technologies and methodologies in the field of instructional design. By demonstrating your flexibility and eagerness to grow, you reassure employers that you can hit the ground running and become a valuable asset to their organization.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile securing an instructional design job without prior experience may seem daunting, it is possible with the right strategies and mindset. By showcasing your transferable skills, developing a strong portfolio through bootcamps and practical experience, understanding team dynamics and stakeholder engagement, continuously learning, and networking effectively, you can break into the instructional design field. Remember, persistence, a passion for learning, and a proactive approach to building your skill set will set you apart from other candidates. With dedication and determination, you can prove to employers that you have what it takes to excel as an instructional designer, even without the traditional years of experience they may initially seek.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nMy Journey from the Classroom to Instructional Designer - A Teacher's Transition:\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nMy Journey from the Classroom to Instructional Designer - A Teacher's Transition:\n\nAs an instructional designer, I often get asked about my transition from being a traditional classroom teacher to designing instructional materials. Yes, both roles revolve around the noble cause of education and learning. However, they are as different as apples and oranges, and shifting from one role to the other has been quite a journey filled with unexpected challenges.\n\nWhen I was a teacher, my job was hands-on. I interacted with my students daily, delivering content, managing classroom dynamics, assessing student understanding, and giving immediate feedback. It was a role that required me to think on my feet and respond to the unique needs, abilities, and interests of my students in real-time.\n\nNow, as an instructional designer, my work environment is significantly different. I work primarily behind the scenes, analyzing learning needs, designing instructional materials - from online courses to interactive simulations - and assessing the effectiveness of these materials. It's a role that requires me to anticipate learner needs and design solutions to meet these needs well in advance.\n\nThe most striking difference between the two roles lies in their approach to learning. As a teacher, my approach was more directive, guiding students along a predetermined path of learning. As an instructional designer, I've had to adopt a more constructivist approach, creating learning environments that allow learners to construct their own knowledge through exploration and discovery.\n\nThough I work in the same broad field of education, the transition from teaching to instructional design was not as smooth as one might expect.\n\nFirstly, the skillsets required for each role are quite different. As a teacher, I had honed my skills in classroom management, direct instruction, and formative assessment. Now, I've had to acquire new skills in multimedia design, technology integration, project management, and data analysis.\n\nSecondly, the shift in perspective from being the primary source of knowledge to creating environments where learners can explore and discover knowledge on their own has been a significant adjustment. This shift required me to develop a different understanding of the learning process and a new mindset about my role as an educator.\n\nThirdly, the lack of direct interaction with learners has been a major adjustment. As an instructional designer, I am removed from the immediate learning environment and have to rely on feedback from others to assess the effectiveness of my designs. Initially, this led to feelings of disconnect and uncertainty, which were difficult to manage.\n\nFinally, I faced practical challenges. I had to acquire new technical skills, like proficiency in authoring tools and learning management systems. The job market for instructional designers is also quite different, and it took me time and effort to find and secure a suitable position.\n\nIn the end, despite the initial challenges, the transition from teaching to instructional design has been incredibly rewarding. My journey has required a new mindset, new skills, and a willingness to adapt to new ways of thinking about learning and teaching. But as I shape the future of learning in this rapidly evolving educational landscape, I realize that each challenge I've faced has helped me grow professionally and personally. It's been a journey worth taking, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nNavigating the Future of Instructional Design: Why Leadership and Project Management Skills Are Essential\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nThe Dual Powerhouse: Leadership and Project Management Skills for Aspiring Instructional Designers:\n\nIn the modern era, the role of instructional designers is becoming increasingly crucial as digital learning platforms, eLearning courses, and online educational materials continue to surge in popularity. While technical prowess and pedagogical knowledge are critical facets of instructional design, there's an emerging need for professionals in this field to possess strong leadership and project management skills.\n\nBut why? What makes these qualities so indispensable for aspiring instructional designers, and how can they provide an edge in a competitive job market?\n\nThe Expanding Horizon of Instructional DesignPreviously, instructional design primarily focused on developing educational content. But today, instructional designers are not just content creators—they're project leads, team coordinators, and even client liaisons. They're expected to collaborate with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), graphic designers, IT specialists, and other stakeholders to ensure the successful execution of a learning initiative. This multifaceted role demands more than domain expertise; it requires the ability to steer the ship. Enter leadership and project management skills.\n\nLeadership: More than Just Being in Charge\n\nLeadership doesn't necessarily mean holding the highest title or being the final decision-maker. It means:\n\nVisionary Thinking: As an instructional designer, it's essential to envision the end goal and articulate it in a way that motivates and guides the team.\n\nEmpowerment: Great leaders empower those around them, fostering an environment where team members feel confident to share ideas and take initiative.\n\nEffective Communication: Clear and concise communication ensures everyone is aligned, minimizing misunderstandings or costly errors.\n\nConflict Resolution: Differences in opinion are inevitable. Influential leaders can navigate these challenges, ensuring that issues are resolved in a way that respects all parties and keeps the project on track.\n\n2. Project Management: Steering the Ship\n\nIn the realm of instructional design, projects often have many moving parts. From ideation to final delivery, project management ensures everything runs smoothly. This encompasses:\n\nPlanning and Scheduling: What are the milestones? What's the timeline? Project management skills help instructional designers to plot the roadmap.\n\nResource Allocation: Whether it's budget, tools, or human resources, effective allocation is crucial to ensure that projects don't stall due to a lack of resources.\n\nRisk Management: Every project has its risks. Identifying, assessing, and planning for potential roadblocks ensures the project remains resilient.\n\nQuality Assurance: It's not just about getting it done; it's about doing it right. Project management involves regular check-ins to ensure quality isn't compromised.\n\n3. Standing Out in the Job Market\n\nFor instructional designers looking to differentiate themselves in a crowded job market, here's how these skills can elevate your profile:\n\nDemonstrated Competence: Beyond your portfolio, showcasing your leadership and project management prowess can assure potential employers of your capability to lead projects from start to finish.\n\nFlexibility: With these skills, you aren't just an instructional designer. You can slot into various roles within a project, from lead designer to project manager.\n\nClient Relationships: For firms offering instructional design services, having designers who can manage client relationships is invaluable. It streamlines communication and ensures that client needs are directly integrated into the design process.\n\n4. Real-World Scenarios\n\nTo put this into perspective, consider these situations:\n\nAn eLearning project is facing delays due to miscommunication between the content team and the IT department. An instructional designer with solid leadership skills steps in facilitates communication, realigns the units, and gets the project back on track.\n\nAn online course, halfway through development, faces budgetary constraints. With adept project management skills, the instructional designer reevaluates resource allocation, prioritizes essential components, and ensures the project continues without compromising quality.\n\nIn both cases, the instructional designer is not just a creator but a problem solver, leader, and manager.\n\n5. Continuous Learning and Skill Development\n\nIf you're an instructional designer aiming to bolster your leadership and project management skills, remember that learning is a continuous journey. Consider courses, workshops, and certifications in leadership and project management. Join online communities or forums related to these domains to engage, share, and learn from industry professionals.\n\n6.

Click below.\nUnlocking the Secrets of Instructional Design: Your Complete Blueprint\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nA Letter to New 24/7 Teach Instructional Designers:\n\nWelcome to the team! As you step into the exhilarating world of instructional design, it's crucial to recognize that this journey is about more than just crafting content; it's about architecting transformative, learner-centric experiences. As the lead instructional designer, I can attest that the instructional design process serves as the backbone of our work, guiding us from the initial spark of an idea to a fully realized educational experience. For both newcomers and those refining their approach, a profound appreciation for this process isn't just beneficial—it's essential. It ensures we speak a common language, operate cohesively, and consistently churn out high-quality learning resources. Remember, understanding this process is not only the foundation of our craft but also the key to unlocking your potential as a compelling educator and change-maker. \n\nLet's delve deep into this systematic journey together, ensuring that every learning experience we craft makes a tangible difference.\n\n1. Needs Analysis\n\nWhat is it?\nThis is the foundation. Before you start designing, you need to determine the 'why' behind your project.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nPerformance Analysis: Determine if there’s a performance gap and if training is the solution.\n\nAudience Analysis: Understand the demographics, prior knowledge, and learning preferences of your learners.\n\nTask Analysis: Break down the job or skill into its component tasks.\n\nSee our previous post on Needs Analysis for more details.\n\n2. Define Objectives\n\nWhat is it?\nClearly articulating what learners will be able to achieve by the end of the training.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nUse action verbs to describe what learners should be able to do.\n\nEnsure objectives are measurable. For example, “By the end of this module, learners will be able to list five major causes of X.”\n\nSee our previous post on developing Performance Objectives for more details.\n\n3. Designing the Content\n\nWhat is it?\nStructuring and organizing your content to ensure logical and effective transfer of knowledge.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nScope the Content: Decide on the depth and breadth of the material.\n\nOrganize the Content: Sequence it from simple to complex or in order of importance.\n\nChoose Delivery Methods: Decide if the training will be e-learning, face-to-face, blended, etc.\n\nSee our previous post on Design Methodologies for more details.\n\n4. Developing Materials\n\nWhat is it?\nTranslating your design into tangible learning materials.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nCreate Storyboards: Plan how each section of your course will look and function.\n\nDevelop Content: Write scripts, create visuals, and build interactions.\n\nSelect Tools: Use e-learning development tools like Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, or more traditional mediums, depending on your delivery method.\n\n5. Implementation\n\nWhat is it?\nRolling out your designed content to your target audience.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nPilot Testing: Before full deployment, test the course with a small group from your target audience.\n\nFeedback Collection: Gather feedback to ensure the training meets objectives.\n\nFull Roll-out: Deploy your course to the full audience.\n\n6. Evaluation\n\nWhat is it?\nAssessing the effectiveness of the training.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nFormative Evaluation: Conduct evaluations during the design and development phases. These are usually internal reviews or small group feedback sessions.\n\nSummative Evaluation: Conduct post-implementation. Use tests, surveys, and observations to measure learning outcomes.\n\nRemember, evaluation is not just about the end result but also about the process. Donald Kirkpatrick’s Four-Level Model is a great place to start, evaluating four levels: Reaction, Learning, Behavior, and Results.\n\nDigging Deeper:\n\nBuilding upon your understanding of the instructional design process, let's delve further into some crucial aspects, offering deeper insights and practical applications for each step.\n\n7. Incorporate Active Learning\n\nWhat is it?\nIt’s the practice of involving learners actively in their own learning process rather than being passive recipients.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nDiscussion Forums: Encourage learners to discuss topics, fostering peer learning.\n\nHands-on Projects: These allow learners to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.\n\nSimulations: Especially beneficial for complex processes or risky scenarios.\n\n8. Utilizing Multimedia Principles\n\nWhat is it?\nIt's about effectively using text, graphics, audio, and video in your content based on proven multimedia learning theories.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nBalance Audio & Visual Elements: Don't overwhelm with too much at once. If narrating a point, keep on-screen text minimal.\n\nUse Relevant Graphics: Ensure images and graphics enhance understanding rather than serving as mere decoration.\n\n9. Inclusion of Feedback Loops\n\nWhat is it?\nCreating avenues for continuous feedback throughout the learning process.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nQuizzes: Integrate short quizzes at intervals to reinforce learning and provide instant feedback.\n\nReflective Activities: Prompt learners to reflect on what they’ve learned, integrating insights into their mental frameworks.\n\n10. Cultivate a Sense of Community\n\nWhat is it?\nPromoting a sense of belonging and collaboration among learners, especially in digital learning environments.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nPeer Reviews: Allow learners to review each other's work.\n\nGroup Projects: Foster collaboration and diverse perspectives.\n\nCommunity Forums: A place for learners to ask questions, share resources, and build connections.\n\n11. Consider Accessibility and Inclusivity\n\nWhat is it?\nEnsuring content is accessible to all, regardless of physical or cognitive disabilities.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nSubtitles: For video content, ensuring those with hearing impairments can follow along.\n\nScreen Reader Compatibility: Ensure content can be read aloud for visually impaired learners.\n\nDiverse Representation: Include examples, scenarios, and images that represent a diverse range of people.\n\nBonus Tips for New Instructional Designers:\n\nStay Learner-Centered: Always keep the needs and preferences of your learners in mind. It's easy to get carried away with fancy design elements or to include too much content, but if it doesn't serve the learner, reconsider its inclusion.\n\nIterate, Iterate, Iterate: Rarely will your first version be your best version. Continually refine your materials based on feedback and evolving needs.\n\nCollaborate: Engage with subject matter experts, other instructional designers, and anyone else who can offer valuable insights.\n\nStay Updated: The world of instructional design is dynamic. Tools, theories, and methods evolve. Dedicate time to professional development.\n\nReflection and Continuous Improvement: One crucial element that wasn’t mentioned previously but is worth highlighting is the iterative nature of instructional design. As a budding instructional designer, I've found that my first draft is rarely my final. After rolling out a course, gather feedback, analyze results, and be prepared to make changes. This isn’t a sign of a poor initial design; it's a hallmark of a designer committed to excellence.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEmbarking on the instructional design path has been one of the most fulfilling journeys of my life. With every learning experience I craft or training project I lead, I view it as a new opportunity to facilitate change, growth, and empowerment. Remember, as an instructional designer, your impact extends beyond the confines of a classroom, board room, or digital module. Your work has the potential to transform lives, careers, and communities. With every project you undertake, embrace this privilege and responsibility, and let it guide you towards creating meaningful and lasting learning experiences.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nIn light of the importance of the instructional design process, how can you continuously refine and adapt the instructional design methodologies listed above to address the ever-evolving needs of our learners?\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nWhy Analysis is Essential to your Instructional Design Process and How to Excel at It\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWhy Analysis is Crucial for Effective Instructional Design and How to Excel at It?\n\nHaving worked as a lead instructional designer, I can confidently say that acing the analysis phase is paramount for project success. When my team and I embarked on the challenge to create a leadership development curriculum specifically for women in government, grasping the 'why,' 'what,' and 'who' was imperative before immersing ourselves in the intricate process of shaping this vital training. This belief led my team to become deeply engrossed in the analysis phase, which I consider critical regardless of the instructional design framework used.\n\nThe Essence of the Analysis Stage: \n\nThe crux of the analysis phase is an in-depth exploration of the specific need for a learning solution. It answers pivotal questions: What's the existing knowledge gap or problem? Who is our target audience? What do they already know, and where are they lacking? What do we hope they'll gain from this? And, in what context will they learn? The clarity from these answers sketches out a roadmap, guiding the subsequent phases of design, development, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nNavigating the Analysis Phase in Various Frameworks:\n\nADDIE: Within ADDIE, the analysis is its inception. Here, we painstakingly dissect the learning issue, discern the needs of learners, draft the objectives, and set the stage for the impending Design phase. It's a rigorous probe that crystallizes expectations and harmonizes the instructional approach with the learner's requirements and the organization's goals.\n\nSAM (Successive Approximation Model): SAM, with its iterative flair, has its 'Preparation' phase resonate with the traditional models' analysis phase. Here, we gather intel on learners, context, and learning goals. Because of its cyclical design, it's also about crafting a preliminary prototype of the solution. This aims to swiftly examine and validate assumptions, ensuring our solutions stay rooted and pertinent as they evolve.\n\nDick and Carey Model: Esteemed in the instructional design realm, the Dick and Carey Model begins by pinpointing instructional ambitions. Goal and Learner Analyses form its heart. In this space, we articulate the outcomes we hope our learners will achieve post-instruction and delve into understanding learner nuances. It paves a clear trajectory toward setting performance goals, assessment tools, and teaching strategies.\n\nThe Imperative of the Analysis Phase:\n\nFoundational Integrity: Similar to how edifices need a robust base, a learning solution demands a lucid comprehension of its goals and learners. The analysis grants this foundational insight, ensuring our solution is stable and relevant.\n\nMaintaining Pertinence: Absent a meticulous analysis, there's a risk of drifting from the real needs of the learners or the organization's objectives. To craft impactful solutions, we dive deep into the learner's realm, recognizing their hurdles, aspirations, and pain points.\n\nOptimal Utilization of Resources: A misguided direction can squander invaluable resources. By charting a clear learning trajectory, we better position ourselves to allocate resources, streamlining the development journey judiciously.\n\nAcing the Analysis Phase - Pro Tips:\n\nInitiate Stakeholder Involvement Early: Collaborating with stakeholders, from Subject Matter Experts to learners and organizational torchbearers, guarantees a comprehensive grasp of both problem and solution.\n\nWalk in the Learners' Shoes: Delve into learners' psyches using tools like personas, interviews, and polls. Familiarize yourself with their drives, challenges, and learning tastes.\n\nStay Nimble: Agility is critical, especially in frameworks like SAM. Employ insights from the analysis to polish the solution, even if it warrants revisiting earlier stages.\n\nDocument Religiously: A meticulous log of your discoveries, suppositions, and choices becomes an invaluable touchstone throughout the design trajectory.\n\nAmplifying the Analysis Through Technology & Human Touch: \n\nModern-day tech, like Learning Management Systems, unveils behavioral trends and patterns, highlighting modules that captivate learners or areas they grapple with. Yet, the human facet is irreplaceable. Personal interactions, focus groups, and learner observations unveil layers of depth that raw data might overlook. This symbiosis of data-driven and human insights enriches the analysis stage.\n\nPitfalls and Their Antidotes:\n\nAnalysis Paralysis: Being comprehensive is vital, but over-analysis can hamper progress. Draw a line. Set tangible objectives for the analysis stage, and once met, lean on your data and progress.\n\nAvoiding a 'One-Size-Fits-All' Trap: Recognize that each learner group is distinct. Refrain from overlaying previous analysis as a stencil. Each challenge warrants a fresh, custom analysis.\n\nNeglecting Organizational Culture: An organization's ethos significantly influences how a course is received. Delve into the company's culture to ensure the solution resonates with its core values.\n\nChampioning Continuous Analysis: Adopt an ethos where analysis isn't bracketed to a project's outset. Foster a culture that thrives on perpetual feedback and fine-tuning. As the world pivots, so do our learners. By recurrently revisiting the analysis, even post-launch, our solutions stay fresh, effective, and resonate with learners.\n\nIn Summation, I trust this deep dive illuminates our approach. In sculpting our leadership curriculum for women, the analysis was not just a starting point but our guiding star. My team and I wielded the might of technology and cherished the intricate details gleaned from human interactions. We stayed vigilant against potential pitfalls, embracing a spirit of ceaseless refinement. Our loftier goal isn't merely addressing the immediate needs but inspiring a transformative change, emboldening the women leaders of today and those yet to emerge.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nHow can integrating both qualitative and quantitative data during the analysis phase optimize the design of training, and what are the potential risks of relying too heavily on one type of data over the other?\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nTransforming Onboarding: How Training, Data, and Alignment Lead to Success with Articulate Storyline\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nTurning Challenges into Triumphs - A Journey of Learning, Efficiency, and Impact with Articulate Storyline:\n\nIntroduction\n\nMy team marked a significant achievement recently as we wrapped up our first onboarding branching scenario using Articulate Storyline. The journey was not without its challenges, especially considering that most of the team were novices when it came to Storyline. Yet, despite this learning curve, we managed to successfully complete the project within the required timeframe. In this blog post, I'm excited to share the insights I gained throughout this process. While I can't provide access to the actual proprietary content we developed, I will offer you a glimpse into our experiences and the valuable lessons we learned.\n\nEnsuring Team Alignment with Project Needs\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the most critical factors that contributed to our success was the alignment of our team's capabilities with the project's demands. Each team member brought their unique strengths and expertise to the table, and we recognized the importance of leveraging these strengths effectively.\n\nFor example, we conducted a skills assessment to gauge everyone's familiarity with Storyline and related instructional design tools. This assessment revealed a significant gap in the skills and time necessary to successfully complete our project. We determined that several members required additional training for the project. And by conducting the project analysis early, we were able to organize training in a way that supported our project deadline.\n\nEffective Training: A Shortcut to Hours Saved\n\nNavigating a new software like Articulate Storyline was uncharted territory for most of our team members. However, investing time in training and upskilling proved to be a game-changer. Because of the tight deadline, we decided that \"learning on the job,\" assuming that we'd pick up the software's nuances as we went along, would be inefficient and lead to us missing our deadline. Instead, we realized the need for effective training. We enlisted the help of another colleague, who provided efficient, streamlined training based on the project objectives we had outlined.\n\nThis investment in learning paid off in spades. Tailoring the training to the needs of the project saved us from sifting through tutorials that were not applicable. Although the colleague who provided the training also joined our team, the other team members gained enough proficiency to quickly create entire Storyline branches on their own with minimal support. The newfound proficiency significantly reduced the time spent grappling with software intricacies, allowing us to focus more on the creative and instructional aspects of the project. The hours saved were a testament to the power of effective training.\n\nGathering Data for Relevance\n\nAs we analyzed the onboarding branching scenario project, we realized that crafting a meaningful and effective learning experience required more than just technical prowess. We needed to ensure that the scenarios we were creating resonated with our target audience – new team members who would soon step into their roles. To achieve this, we turned to the power of data, harnessing qualitative and quantitative surveys to gather insights that would shape our content.\n\nQuantitative questions helped us pinpoint specific topics where interns needed the most guidance. Through open-ended questions, we asked them to share the challenges they faced and the strategies that helped them in their new roles. The responses were enlightening. We could confidently tailor our branching scenarios to be not only informative but also relevant and applicable. The scenarios became more than just interactive learning exercises; they evolved into immersive simulations of real-world challenges our new team members would likely encounter.\n\nPrototyping: Building an Efficient Learning System\n\nOne of the pivotal moments in our journey was the realization that prototyping could drastically enhance our efficiency. Instead of jumping headfirst into full-fledged content creation, we decided to create a prototype of our branching scenario. This served as a blueprint, allowing us to visualize the entire learning experience before investing significant time in detailed development.\n\nThe prototyping phase helped us identify potential roadblocks, assess the feasibility of our design, and gather valuable feedback from stakeholders. It acted as a safety net, preventing us from investing excessive effort into a design that might not have achieved our desired learning outcomes. This iterative approach allowed us to fine-tune our content and structure while minimizing the need for major revisions later in the process.\n\nEffective Planning Saves Revision Time\n\nIntegrating survey insights into our scenario development paved the way for exceptional stakeholder satisfaction, rooted in the relevance of our content to both interns and organizational objectives. The scenarios, finely tuned to address interns' real-world challenges, resonated with stakeholders, who recognized the value of aligning training with authentic experiences. This connection generated an organic sense of authenticity, seamlessly integrating into the broader training strategy.\n\nFurthermore, stakeholders' positive perception of the scenarios' relevance translated into a cohesive QA process, saving valuable time and resources, and minimizing the need for extensive revisions. The content's seamless integration with organizational goals established a sense of purpose and impact, creating a ripple effect that not only resonated with stakeholders but also elevated the project's efficiency and overall success.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur journey into Articulate Storyline, culminating in the completion of a successful onboarding branching scenario, was a profound learning experience. The insights we gained are a testament to how the power of effective planning, the efficiency of prototyping, the value of training, and the importance of aligning team capabilities with project needs can transform challenges into triumphs. Embracing the challenge of navigating new software and creating impactful scenarios, we proved that investing in training is an investment in efficiency. Our embrace of prototyping highlighted the value of iteration, ensuring not just functional content but exceptional learning experiences. Leveraging survey data to shape our scenarios showcased that relevance is not a luxury, but a necessity, fostering stakeholder satisfaction and driving the efficiency of our QA process. As we move forward, armed with these insights, we are inspired to continuously strive for excellence in our instructional design endeavors. \n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation by answering in the comment section below:\n\nHow does the approach to prototyping and tailored training, as described in the blog post, align with your own experiences in instructional design?

Click below.\nAndragogy vs. Pedagogy in Instructional Design and Their Impact on Learning - Unveiling the Distinct\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nUnderstanding the Distinction between Andragogy and Pedagogy in Instructional Design: \n\nIntroduction: \n\nIn the field of instructional design, two terms frequently mentioned are \"andragogy\" and \"pedagogy.\" While they share the goal of facilitating effective learning experiences, they differ in their approach and application. Understanding the distinctions between andragogy and pedagogy is essential for instructional designers seeking to create impactful and learner-centered educational materials. In this blog post, we will delve into the definitions, principles, and practical applications of both concepts in instructional design.\n\nDefining Andragogy and Pedagogy\n\nPedagogy: Pedagogy refers to the science and art of teaching children and young learners. Derived from the Greek words \"paidos\" (child) and \"agogos\" (leading), pedagogy places the teacher at the center of the learning process. Pedagogical approaches typically involve direct instruction, structured curriculum, and a focus on providing clear objectives and guidance. The teacher assumes the role of the authority figure, transferring knowledge and skills to the learners.\n\nAndragogy: Coined by Malcolm Knowles in the 1970s, andragogy is the art and science of teaching adults. Derived from the Greek words \"andros\" (man) and \"agogos\" (leading), andragogy is centered on the idea that adults have different learning needs and motivations compared to children. Andragogy emphasizes self-directed learning, active participation, and drawing upon the learners' prior experiences to facilitate meaningful learning. It recognizes the adult learner as a collaborative partner in the educational process.\n\nPedagogy Principles: \n\na. Teacher-centered: Pedagogy places the teacher in the role of the expert and decision-maker. \n\nb. Structured and sequential: The curriculum is carefully designed and structured to build knowledge incrementally. \n\nc. Clear objectives: Learning outcomes and objectives are explicitly defined by the teacher. \n\nd. Direct instruction: Teachers use a variety of strategies, including lectures, demonstrations, and guided practice, to impart knowledge. \n\ne. Evaluation and assessment: Assessments are used to measure the learners' understanding and progress.\n\nAndragogy Principles: \n\na. Learner-centered: Andragogy places the learner at the center, recognizing their autonomy and self-direction in learning. \n\nb. Prior experience: Adult learners' prior knowledge and experiences are considered valuable resources for learning. \n\nc. Active participation: Adults are encouraged to actively participate in the learning process through discussions, problem-solving, and collaborative activities. \n\nd. Relevance: Learning is more meaningful when it is directly applicable to the adult learners' lives and experiences. \n\ne. Self-directed learning: Adults take responsibility for their learning, setting their goals and managing their progress.\n\nApplication in Instructional Design:\n\nPedagogical Applications: Pedagogy is commonly used in traditional educational settings, such as elementary, middle, and high schools. Instructional designers who adopt pedagogical approaches focus on creating structured lesson plans, clear objectives, and teacher-led activities. They design materials that facilitate knowledge transfer and provide explicit instruction. Strategies like lectures, worksheets, and assessments align with the principles of pedagogy. However, it is crucial to incorporate elements of learner engagement and interactivity to enhance the learning experience.\n\nAndragogical Applications: Andragogy finds its place in adult learning contexts, including corporate training, professional development programs, and higher education for adult learners. Instructional designers implementing andragogical principles aim to create learner-centered environments that promote self-directed learning and leverage the learners' prior experiences. Design strategies include interactive e-learning modules, group discussions, case studies, simulations, and real-world problem-solving activities. These approaches stimulate active participation and help adults connect new knowledge to their existing knowledge and skills.\n\nBlending Pedagogy and Andragogy: Effective instructional design often involves a blend of pedagogical and andragogical approaches, depending on the learners' characteristics and context. For instance, in higher education, a mix of pedagogical and andragogical strategies may be employed to accommodate traditional-aged students and adult learners within the same program. A balanced approach allows for structured instruction while also promoting autonomy and active engagement.\n\nExploring the Overlapping Concepts of Andragogy and Pedagogy:\n\nWhile andragogy and pedagogy are often presented as distinct approaches, it's important to recognize that they are not mutually exclusive. There is an inherent overlap between the two concepts, and instructional designers can draw upon elements from both to create comprehensive learning experiences. Let's explore some of the commonalities:\n\nLearner Engagement: Both andragogy and pedagogy recognize the importance of engaging learners in the educational process. While pedagogy often involves teacher-led activities, it can still incorporate interactive elements to capture learners' attention and foster engagement. Similarly, andragogy acknowledges that not all adults are self-directed learners from the start, and some may benefit from structured instruction and guidance.\n\nLearning Objectives: Both approaches require clear learning objectives. Pedagogy relies on predetermined objectives set by the teacher, whereas andragogy involves collaboration between the teacher and adult learners to identify their specific goals and align them with the learning outcomes.\n\nFeedback and Assessment: Both andragogy and pedagogy emphasize the importance of feedback and assessment to monitor learners' progress. Pedagogical approaches often employ formal assessments, while andragogy may include self-assessment and reflection as tools for adult learners to evaluate their own growth.\n\nAdaptability: Both approaches recognize the need for flexibility and adaptability in the learning process. Instructional designers must be responsive to the learners' needs and adjust the instructional methods accordingly, whether it be modifying a lesson plan based on student feedback or tailoring content to adult learners' prior experiences.\n\nThe Evolving Landscape of Instructional Design:\n\nIn recent years, the landscape of instructional design has expanded to accommodate various learning contexts and preferences. With advancements in technology, the availability of online learning platforms, and the rise of blended learning models, instructional designers now have a broader range of tools and approaches at their disposal.\n\nInstructional designers are increasingly adopting learner-centered approaches that incorporate elements of both andragogy and pedagogy. This learner-centric design focuses on creating personalized learning paths, fostering learner autonomy, and incorporating interactive and engaging activities. By leveraging technology, instructional designers can provide learners with access to resources, collaborative platforms, and self-paced modules that cater to their individual needs and preferences.\n\nMoreover, the rise of microlearning and just-in-time learning has led to the development of bite-sized, easily accessible learning modules. These modules align with andragogical principles by offering adults the flexibility to acquire knowledge and skills in a manner that fits into their busy schedules and specific requirements.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the realm of instructional design, understanding the nuances between andragogy and pedagogy is essential for creating effective and impactful learning experiences. While they differ in their focus and application, these concepts share common elements and can be blended to meet the needs of diverse learners.\n\nInstructional designers should strive to create learner-centered environments that balance structure, guidance, and autonomy. By incorporating interactive activities, leveraging technology, and drawing upon learners' prior experiences, designers can optimize the learning process and promote meaningful engagement.\n\nAs instructional design continues to evolve, it is crucial for designers to adapt their approaches to meet the changing needs of learners in today's dynamic world. By embracing a flexible mindset and integrating the principles of both andragogy and pedagogy, instructional designers can pave the way for effective, learner-focused educational experiences.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nHow to Develop Time Estimates for eLearning Development and the Impact of AI\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nGet a Grip on Time Estimates for eLearning Development and the Revolutionary Impact of AI:\n\nWhen asked, \"How long will it take to create this training or course?\" as a CEO of an instructional design service provider, my response needs to encapsulate the complexities of eLearning development and accurately estimate the time and effort required. This balance is crucial in avoiding underbidding, which can lead to financial losses, or overbidding, which can cost potential projects.\n\nPreviously, I've found significant benchmarks in the works of Bryan Chapman, Karl Kapp, and Robyn Defelice. While these benchmarks serve as invaluable guides, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in eLearning has drastically altered the landscape, expediting processes and modifying time estimates for the better. In this post, I aim to delve into the dynamic intersection of AI and eLearning development, highlighting how AI has revolutionized how we develop and deliver instructional content.\n\nAI: A Game Changer in Instructional Design\n\nThe role of AI in eLearning extends far beyond just 'smart recommendations' and personalized learning paths. By automating various stages of eLearning development, AI has significantly reduced the time and effort traditionally required in instructional design.\n\nAI in Content Creation: \n\nAI-powered tools now support digital content creation, drastically reducing the time spent on the task. They can sift through massive volumes of information, summarizing key points and generating first drafts of content. This process could typically consume around 70% of an instructional designer's time, but with AI, it's completed within a fraction of that.\n\nAdaptive Learning Design: \n\nAI has simplified the once-complex task of creating adaptive learning paths. An AI system can analyze learner behavior and performance data, then make informed decisions about the next steps in the learner's journey. This automated decision-making process eliminates the need for instructional designers to manually analyze data and update the course design, saving considerable time.\n\nAutomated Course Updates: \n\nAI tools can analyze learner feedback and performance data to identify areas for improvement in the course. These tools can then automatically update course content to meet learners' needs better, sparing instructional designers from manually tweaking the course after each learner cohort.\n\nIntelligent Authoring Tools: \n\nAI-powered authoring tools have made eLearning development faster and more efficient. With features like automated template selection, rapid content import, and adaptation, these tools drastically reduce development time. IconLogic estimates, for instance, that traditional authoring could take 2 hours per finished minute. However, with AI-enhanced authoring tools, this could be reduced significantly.\n\nEfficient Project Management: \n\nAI has also found its place in streamlining project management. With AI-powered tools, resource allocation, timeline prediction, and task coordination can all be automated, saving project managers countless hours.\n\nRevised Time Estimates with AI\n\nTo illustrate the impact of AI on eLearning development times, let's look at a hypothetical project. If we leverage AI, the estimates could be adjusted as follows:\n\nFront End Analysis: Reduced from 30 to 15 hours\n\nInstructional Design: Reduced from 60 to 30 hours\n\nStoryboarding: Reduced from 55 to 25 hours\n\nGraphic Production: Reduced from 66 to 30 hours\n\nAuthoring/Programming: Reduced from 180 to 100 hours\n\nProject Management: Reduced from 20 to 10 hours\n\nPilot Test: Reduced from 6 to 3 hours\n\nThe total development time drops from 450 hours to 213 hours, a dramatic 53% decrease, and that's a conservative estimate.\n\nAI in Quality Assurance and Testing\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) and testing is another area where AI has significantly impacted. Conventionally, the process involves several stages - identifying errors, communicating them to the design team, corrections, and repeated testing. This is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. For our sample project, the manual QA estimate is around 33 hours.\n\nHowever, AI-enhanced quality testing tools have transformed this process. These tools can automate error detection in content, including technical bugs, accessibility issues, and inconsistencies in design. They provide precise error reports and can even suggest potential fixes, significantly shortening the feedback loop.\n\nMoreover, AI can also be used for 'predictive testing.' It can analyze the data from initial tests and identify potential problem areas in the course, allowing the team to address them proactively. By automating and optimizing the QA and testing process, AI tools can reduce the estimated time by more than half, from 33 to approximately 15 hours.\n\nAI in Audio Production and Translation\n\nPreviously, audio production required a substantial investment of time and resources. The task was even more daunting if the course had to be delivered in multiple languages. But with the integration of AI in eLearning development, we've witnessed a significant reduction in time and effort in these areas.\n\nAdvanced text-to-speech (TTS) AI tools can generate high-quality, natural-sounding audio for eLearning courses. Moreover, these tools can generate audio in multiple languages and accents, eliminating the need for hiring voice artists and translators, thereby significantly reducing the time and cost of audio production.\n\nWhile professional voice-over might still be preferred for certain types of content, AI-generated audio has improved dramatically over the years and can serve as a quicker and more economical alternative for many projects.\n\nReview and Revisions: Streamlining with AI\n\nClient reviews and revisions are an integral part of eLearning development. Often filled with endless email threads, document versions, and communication issues, these stages can significantly extend the project timeline.\n\nAI-powered project management tools offer a centralized platform for reviews, incorporating real-time collaborative editing and automatic version control. With instant notifications and progress tracking, these tools can speed up the revision process, reducing the time required and enhancing the quality of the final product.\n\nMoreover, AI can also analyze past revisions, learning from them to predict common changes and suggest improvements proactively in future projects. This results in a continuous improvement cycle, reducing the time required for reviews and revisions with each subsequent project.\n\nWith all these improvements in place, let's adjust our earlier estimates:\n\nQA Testing: Reduced from 33 to 15 hours\n\nAudio Production: Assuming half of the course uses AI-generated audio, the time could be reduced from 30 to 15 hours\n\nSME/Stakeholder Reviews: Assuming AI-powered project management tools streamline communication and revisions, this could be reduced from 30 to 15 hours\n\nThese AI-driven efficiencies further reduce our total time from 213 to 163 hours.\n\nIn essence, the inclusion of AI in the eLearning sphere has fundamentally transformed instructional design production. It has automated and streamlined previously laborious tasks, significantly reducing development time and improving output quality. As we continue to harness the potential of AI, we can look forward to more enhancements, crafting an ever-evolving landscape of efficient, impactful, and learner-centered eLearning solutions.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that while AI offers incredible advantages, the role of a skilled instructional designer remains crucial. AI tools are accelerators and facilitators, but they don't replace the creative thinking, the human touch, and the nuanced understanding of learners' needs that an instructional designer brings to the table.\n\nBy leveraging AI's efficiencies and preserving human ingenuity, we can create a future for eLearning that's both efficient and engaging, offering high-quality learning experiences in record time.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nWhy You Aren't Getting Hired as an Instructional Designer\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nUnveiling the Enigma: Why You Aren't Getting Hired as an Instructional Designer\n\nInstructional design is a unique and increasingly valuable profession in the modern workforce. As our world transitions to a more digital learning environment, businesses and educational institutions are looking for skilled instructional designers to guide their educational initiatives. But what happens when you're not getting the job offers you expect or desire? What could be hindering your chances of being hired as an instructional designer? Let's explore some common reasons and how you can overcome these hurdles.\n\n1. Lack of a well-crafted portfolio\n\nYour portfolio is the key to showcasing your talent, skills, and experience. It's your opportunity to demonstrate your instructional design competence and ability to craft engaging, effective learning experiences. If your portfolio is poorly organized, doesn't effectively showcase your best work, or worse, is non-existent, it could be a significant reason why you're not getting hired.\n\nTo improve your portfolio, make sure it highlights your unique abilities. Showcase various learning modalities (e-learning modules, job aids, lesson plans, etc.) and different kinds of projects. Ensure your work is presented clearly, organized, and aesthetically pleasing.\n\n2. Inadequate Understanding of Learning Theories\n\nInstructional design isn't just about creating attractive learning materials. It's deeply rooted in understanding how people learn, involving cognitive, behavioral, and constructivist theories. If you're struggling to articulate how these theories guide your design process during an interview, it can raise a red flag to employers.\n\nInvest in continuous learning. Brush up on your knowledge of learning theories and instructional design models. Be prepared to articulate how you apply these theories in practice.\n\n3. Insufficient Technological Proficiency\n\nToday's instructional design field heavily leans on technology. Designers are expected to use a variety of tools for creating content, project management, data analysis, and more. If you're not comfortable with tech or lack proficiency in commonly used tools like Adobe Captivate, Articulate Storyline, or learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle, it could be a setback.\n\nUpskill yourself in the latest technology trends in the instructional design field. Gain hands-on experience with popular authoring tools, LMS, video editing software, and analytics tools.\n\n4. Weak Communication Skills\n\nCommunication is vital for an instructional designer. You need to liaise with subject matter experts, stakeholders, learners, and team members. If you're unable to effectively communicate your ideas, receive feedback, or manage expectations, it can put off potential employers.\n\nWork on your communication skills. Practice presenting your ideas succinctly, handling critique positively, and being an active listener.\n\n5. Not Demonstrating Problem-Solving Skills\n\nEvery project has its challenges, and employers want to know how you handle roadblocks. If you're not demonstrating your problem-solving skills during the interview, employers might be left questioning your competency.\n\nDuring interviews, share examples of projects where you faced challenges and how you overcame them. Discuss how you troubleshoot technical issues or navigate differences of opinion in a project.\n\n6. Lack of Adaptability\n\nThe instructional design field is rapidly evolving. As an instructional designer, you should demonstrate an ability to adapt and evolve your skills to meet the needs of the changing environment. If you're sticking to outdated practices or resisting new methodologies, it could hinder your chances.\n\nStay updated with trends in instructional design. Join professional groups, attend webinars, read blogs, and be open to experimenting with new ideas.\n\n7. No Business Acumen\n\nIncreasingly, instructional designers are expected to understand the business side of things. They should comprehend how their work impacts the company’s bottom line and strategic goals. If you fail to exhibit business acumen or understand how your role aligns with  the organization's objectives, it could be a contributing factor to your job search struggles.\n\nTo improve, try to learn more about the business side of the organizations you target. Understand how training and development contribute to their overall success. Articulate this understanding during interviews to show potential employers that you can deliver value beyond just creating engaging content.\n\n8. Lack of a Personalized Application\n\nApplying for a job is more than just sending in your resume. It requires effort to tailor your application according to each company's specific needs and culture. If your applications are generic, it might give employers the impression that you lack genuine interest in their company.\n\nTo stand out, tailor your resume and cover letter to each job. Research about the company, understand their culture, and align your application to the company's specific needs and values.\n\n9. Limited Experience or Expertise in a Niche\n\nWhile being a jack-of-all-trades may have its perks, having expertise in a particular niche can make you more appealing to certain employers. If you lack specialized experience or expertise, it might be harder to get noticed.\n\nConsider gaining more experience in a specific area of instructional design, such as mobile learning, gamification, or microlearning. Having a niche can help you stand out and increase your marketability.\n\n10. Insufficient Networking\n\nNetworking plays a significant role in the job market today. If you're not proactive in building connections and making yourself known in the instructional design community, you may be missing out on potential job opportunities.\n\nJoin instructional design groups, participate in discussions, attend conferences, and connect with other professionals on platforms like LinkedIn. Networking can often lead to job opportunities that aren't publicly advertised.\n\nRemember, rejection is not a reflection of your worth but an opportunity to learn and grow. Instead of being disheartened, use these insights to reflect, refine your skills, and improve your approach. Your next job offer might be just around the corner!\n\nInstructional design is a rewarding and dynamic profession. There's always room to learn, adapt, and evolve, which is what makes it exciting. By addressing these common hurdles, you can boost your chances of getting hired and pave your way to a successful career in instructional design. Be persistent, be proactive, and never stop learning.

Click below.\nThe Supreme Court and Holistic Admissions: What's Next in College Admissions?\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nThe Supreme Court, Affirmative Action, and Holistic Admissions: What's Next in College Admissions?\n\nAs an experienced college admissions counselor and coach, I have always encouraged students to strive for excellence, diversity, and authenticity. However, the recent Supreme Court decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions may significantly change the landscape of the college admissions process. Although it's too early to map out the precise repercussions, several potential implications have been raised, which could significantly impact applicants, particularly those from underrepresented groups.\n\nBefore I delve into these implications, I must clarify what the decision implies. The verdict does not explicitly prohibit colleges from considering race in admissions. Instead, it makes it legally challenging for institutions to do so. This, in turn, could dramatically influence the factors colleges prioritize when admitting students.\n\nLegacy Admissions and Athletics:\n\nOne of the most notable shifts is the possible increased focus on legacy admissions and athletic recruitment. Without race, colleges might lean more heavily on these aspects to shape their incoming classes. This tilt could lead to a decrease in students from underrepresented groups at elite colleges. Legacy admissions often favor families with access to higher education for generations, typically excluding marginalized communities. Similarly, athletic recruitment can be biased towards wealthier families who can afford the resources necessary for their children to excel in sports.\n\nCollege Essays and Extracurriculars:\n\nMoreover, we might see a more significant emphasis on personal essays and extracurricular activities. These components allow colleges to get to know applicants and assess their merits. But therein lies a challenge: not all students have the same access to resources and opportunities. Many students from underrepresented groups may find competing more difficult, given the disparities in availability and accessibility to enrichment programs, writing help, and more.\n\nHolistic Admissions and the Unknown:\n\nThe third potential implication of the Supreme Court's decision is an increased use of holistic review. This admissions process considers various factors such as grades, test scores, extracurricular activities, and personal essays. While the holistic review is already employed by many colleges, it may become even more prevalent in light of this recent decision. In principle, a holistic approach seems equitable—it paints a broader picture of the applicant beyond just academics. However, it's essential to ensure that this review truly embraces diversity and gives equal weight to varied experiences.\n\nHow colleges adapt to the Supreme Court's decision will likely depend on the institution. Some colleges might be more inclined to continue considering race in admissions, while others may drift away from it. It's also plausible that innovative strategies will emerge to consider race indirectly in ways not explicitly prohibited by the court's decision.\n\nWhat we're witnessing is a pivotal moment in college admissions. We must remember, though, that the ultimate goal should remain to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, have equal access to higher education. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, colleges should strive to maintain a diverse student body, recognizing that diversity extends beyond race and includes a range of socio-economic backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.\n\nAs we look ahead, there are things you, as students, can do. First, understand that your story matters. Use your personal essays to articulate your unique experiences and how they have shaped you. Second, make the most of your academic and extracurricular opportunities. If resources are scarce, be creative. Leadership isn't confined to school clubs—it can be demonstrated in your family, community, or job.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while the Supreme Court's decision might bring about challenges, it also offers opportunities for students to showcase their resilience, creativity, and individuality. As an admissions counselor and coach, I remain committed to guiding all students through this evolving landscape, ensuring that their unique voices are heard and their strengths are recognized, no matter what changes may come in college admissions. Together, we can navigate these changes and navigate these uncharted waters.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision indeed poses new challenges and uncertainties. But, as I always remind my students, challenges can be the best catalysts for growth and innovation. Let us embrace this moment as an opportunity—for colleges to devise more inclusive admissions practices and for students to showcase their individuality and potential in new and creative ways.\n\nAs an admissions counselor and coach, I am here for you, ready to guide you through this evolving landscape. Let's continue to strive for an admissions process that appreciates each student's unique story, celebrates diversity, and fosters inclusivity. Together, we can navigate these changes and continue our shared mission: to provide equal access to education for all.\n\nLet's not let this decision deter us. Instead, let's embrace it as a challenge—to continue striving for an inclusive, diverse, and equitable higher education system that recognizes the potential in every student.\n\nThings to Ponder:\n\nHow can you better showcase your or teen’s unique experiences and merits in your personal essays and extracurricular activities, given the heightened emphasis these may receive in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision?\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nWhat is Holistic College Admissions, and How Does it Affect You?\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nUnraveling the Holistic Approach to College Admissions - A Comprehensive Guide for Students:\n\nIn the world of college admissions, the journey often appears as a complex maze of requirements, recommendations, and apprehensions. However, with a holistic approach, this process becomes more about personal development and authenticity and less about ticking off boxes. \n\nThis is the essence of the holistic college admissions process, an approach to higher education applications that prioritizes individual growth and sincere interest over mere numerical metrics. Let's delve into how popular colleges perceive this process.\n\nThe Holistic Admissions Process: \n\nThe holistic college admissions process is a student-centered path to higher education. It encourages self-discovery, authenticity, and personal evolution rather than solely focusing on numerical-centered strategies. Instead of treating college admissions as a daunting mission to overcome, the holistic approach encourages students to view it as an opportunity for introspection and personal advancement.\n\nPopular Colleges and the Holistic Process:\n\nRenowned colleges, including Ivy League institutions and other top-tier schools, have gradually adopted holistic admissions processes that align with the principles of this approach. They look beyond grades and test scores to consider the whole applicant, including their interests, experiences, and potential for growth.\n\nThese colleges acknowledge that students are more than the sum of their GPA and SAT scores. As such, they appreciate applicants who deeply engage with their interests, commit to personal growth, and genuinely understand what they expect from a college education.\n\nSelf-Discovery and Intellectual Curiosity: \n\nProminent colleges highly value self-discovery and intellectual curiosity. They seek to admit students who are eager to learn, prepared to challenge themselves, and able to contribute to the academic community.\n\nFor example, institutions like Stanford and MIT are recognized for emphasizing intellectual vitality. They appreciate students who love learning, pursue their interests beyond the classroom, and engage deeply with ideas. They look for applicants who are academically capable and intellectually engaged.\n\nAuthenticity in Applications: \n\nAuthenticity is a crucial factor that renowned colleges seek in applications. Schools like Harvard and Princeton want to see the person behind the application. This means being truthful about your experiences, interests, and ambitions rather than attempting to present an image of what you presume they want to see.\n\nAuthenticity can be shown in essays, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities. It's about showcasing who you indeed are, what you care about, and how you've developed from your experiences.\n\nThe Role of Academics While the holistic process underscores personal growth and authenticity, academics remain critical. Top-tier colleges, such as the University of Chicago and Columbia University, certainly consider grades and test scores, but they also examine the comprehensive academic journey.\n\nCourse selection, academic improvement over time, and how students have explored their intellectual interests all factor into the admissions process. These colleges appreciate students who display a genuine passion for their field of study, often reflected in their coursework and extracurricular activities.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Leadership: \n\nCommunity involvement and leadership are also highly appreciated by popular colleges. Institutions like Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania value students who have made a positive impact in their communities, whether through volunteer work, leadership roles, or initiating projects.\n\nIn the holistic process, leadership isn't merely about holding a title. It's about making a difference, having an impact, demonstrating resilience, and showing a commitment to personal and community development.\n\nBuilding a College List and deciding on the holistic process should involve more than selecting highly ranked schools. It's about identifying colleges where you can thrive and that align with your academic and personal goals.\n\nWhen decision time arrives, consider the curriculum, campus culture, financial aid, and growth opportunities. Remember, the goal is not just to gain admission but to find a college where you can succeed and flourish.\n\nAdditional Considerations for the Holistic Process:\n\nWhen navigating the holistic admissions process, the role of guidance and mentorship should be taken into account. While the process encourages self-discovery, having a mentor - whether a teacher, counselor, or family member - can offer valuable insights and perspective. They can help you reflect on your experiences, recognize your strengths, and make informed decisions about your college applications.\n\nThe holistic process also underscores the importance of balance. While pursuing your interests and demonstrating commitment is crucial, colleges also value well-rounded individuals who can contribute to their campus community in various ways. Balance your academic interests with other activities, like sports, arts, or community service.\n\nThe Holistic Process and College Interviews:\n\nCollege interviews are another aspect where the holistic process stands out. Interviews provide a chance to display your authenticity and passion. Preparation is key, but remember to be yourself. The interview is not a test but a conversation. Use it as a platform to highlight your experiences, discuss your interests, and ask insightful questions.\n\nInstitutions like Northwestern and Johns Hopkins, which offer evaluative interviews, appreciate students who can articulate their interests, reflect on their high school journey, and demonstrate how they can contribute to the college community.\n\nReflection and Growth: \n\nThe Cornerstones of the Holistic Process The holistic process is fundamentally about reflection and growth. It encourages you to reflect on your high school journey, interests, and goals. It's not merely about getting into college but understanding who you are and who you want to become.\n\nThis reflective practice fosters personal growth. It aids you in identifying your strengths, acknowledging your weaknesses, and developing strategies for improvement. It's a process that extends beyond college admissions, contributing to your overall personal and academic development.\n\nConclusion \n\nUnderstanding the holistic college admissions process from the perspective of popular colleges can demystify the journey to higher education. By embracing self-discovery, authenticity, personal growth, and intellectual curiosity, students can enhance their chances of admission and ensure they select a college that aligns with their goals and aspirations.\n\nThe journey to college is an exhilarating and transformative time. Embrace the holistic process and use it as an opportunity for introspection and growth. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. As you navigate the college admissions process, remember to stay true to yourself and your goals. The right college is one where you can continue your discovery, growth, and learning journey.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nMaking College Affordable: A Comprehensive Guide to Financing Your Higher Education\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nMaking College Affordable: A Comprehensive Guide to Financing Your Higher Education:\n\nPursuing higher education is an exciting journey filled with dreams, aspirations, and promising opportunities. But let's face it, the price tag attached to this pursuit can often cast a shadow on the academic rainbow. It's not just about getting admitted to a dream college but also about being able to afford it.\n\nThis post aims to demystify the complexities around financing a college education. Here are some essential tips to navigate college costs and make your dreams a feasible reality.\n\nUnderstanding the Cost of Attendance (COA):\n\nBefore you start worrying about paying for college, it's crucial to understand the full extent of the costs involved. The Cost of Attendance (COA) is more than just tuition fees. It includes room and board, books, supplies, transportation, and personal expenses. Each college should provide a detailed COA breakdown, so check their websites or contact the admissions office directly. Understanding the COA is your first step to planning how to cover these costs.\n\nScholarships and Grants: Free Money First:\n\nScholarships and grants are often called 'gift aid' because they are free money—financial aid that doesn't have to be repaid. They are available from various sources, including federal and state governments, colleges, and private organizations. Scholarships are usually merit-based, while grants are typically need-based. Apply for as many as you can. Remember, every little bit helps.\n\nWork-Study Programs: Earning While Learning:\n\nFederal Work-Study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial needs, allowing them to earn money to help pay for their education. The program encourages community service work and work related to the student's course of study. Not only does it help with college costs, but it also gives students valuable work experience.\n\nStudent Loans: Borrow Responsibly:\n\nStudent loans should be your last resort, but they are viable if you've exhausted all other resources. Federal loans often offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than private loans. Always remember to borrow only what you need and keep track of your total indebtedness. Remember, loans must be repaid with interest.\n\nConsider Community Colleges or In-State Public Universities:\n\nCommunity colleges or in-state public universities can be significantly cheaper than private institutions or out-of-state schools. Many students choose to start at a community college and then transfer to a four-year institution, which can save a substantial amount of money. Alternatively, many in-state public universities offer excellent education and have the added benefit of in-state tuition rates.\n\n6. Take Advantage of Tax Benefits for Education:\n\nAnother crucial aspect that can help ease the financial burden of college is understanding and utilizing the tax benefits associated with education. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit are examples. The AOTC provides a credit of up to $2,500 per student for the first four years of higher education, while the Lifetime Learning Credit offers up to $2,000 per tax return for any college-level or courses to acquire or improve job skills. Consult with a tax professional or research to understand how these credits apply to your situation.\n\n7. Plan with 529 Plans or Education Savings Accounts:\n\nPlanning for college costs should start long before the first tuition bill arrives. 529 Plans or Education Savings Accounts (ESA) are excellent tools. These are tax-advantaged savings accounts designed to encourage saving for future education costs. The money invested grows tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are also tax-free. Starting these savings early can give your funds time to grow and significantly offset college costs.\n\n8. Leverage Online Learning:\n\nOnline learning has become a vital part of the education landscape in the digital age. Many universities now offer online degrees or certificate programs that are often cheaper than traditional on-campus options. Not only can this help reduce tuition costs, but it can also cut down on other expenses like housing and transportation.\n\n9. Don't Dismiss Part-Time College or Delayed Enrollment:\n\nWhile finishing college in the traditional four-year time frame may be enticing, it's not the only path. Part-time college or delayed enrollment are viable options allowing students to work and save money towards their education. This approach may extend the overall time to graduation but can significantly reduce the accumulated debt.\n\n10. Seek Advice from Financial Aid Counselors:\n\nNavigating the labyrinth of college costs and financial aid options can be overwhelming. That's where financial aid counselors come in. These professionals can provide valuable insights into the process of financial assistance, scholarship opportunities, and more. They can guide you through your unique financial circumstances and help you develop a personalized plan to finance your education.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, remember that the process of paying for college is a journey that requires foresight, planning, and continued effort. Many resources are available, from scholarships and grants to work-study programs and tax benefits. By taking the time to understand and leverage these resources, you can make the most of your financial opportunities and make your college dreams come true.\n\nNavigating the journey to and through college is not just about academic preparedness but financial readiness. The true victory lies not only in getting admitted to the college of your dreams but in paving a financially sound path to get there and beyond. Your future self will thank you!\n\nNote: Always stay updated on changes in financial aid policies. For instance, recent federal financial aid reforms introduced significant changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), such as making the form shorter and simpler to fill out, expanding Pell Grant eligibility, and changing how the Expected Family Contribution is calculated and renamed to the \"Student Aid Index\"​1​. Other changes include adjusting financial aid eligibility during periods of a national emergency like unemployment due to the Covid-19 crisis and eliminating lifetime limits on federal direct subsidized loans​1​.\n\nThese changes can make a significant difference in making college more affordable, so keep an eye on such updates and adjust your college financial plan accordingly. Remember, the path to your dream college must not be paved with financial stress. With careful planning and informed decisions, you can make the dream of higher education an economic reality.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nWhat are Core Values, and How to Identify and Develop Yours\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nEmbarking on a Journey to Uncover and Understand your Core Values\nIntroduction:\n\nWe've all had those moments where we pause, take a deep breath, and ask ourselves, \"What truly matters to me?\" It's in the laughter shared with family, the pride felt after an honest day's work or the peace experienced in solitude. These are fleeting feelings and reflections of our deeply held core values. They shape our choices, mold our behaviors, and give our lives meaning. Let's embark on a journey together, diving deep into what makes us 'us' and uncovering the values that anchor us, especially during life's tumultuous waves. Shall we begin?\n\nUnderstanding Core Values\n\nAt their core, values are beliefs or opinions that significantly influence our lives. They are the underpinning ideas that define our character and drive our reactions to various situations. These beliefs often act as a blueprint for goal-setting and decision-making.\n\nExample: Think of values as the bedrock upon which the foundation of a house (our actions and decisions) is built. Without this bedrock, the place lacks stability and direction.\n\nWhy Are Core Values Vital?\n\nPurpose and Direction: Understanding our core values helps in charting a life course that is truly meaningful and fulfilling.\n\nInformed Decision Making: They serve as a filter, aiding in choices that resonate with our authentic selves.\n\nCareer Alignment: Recognizing personal values can guide career decisions, ensuring a fulfilling professional life.\n\nSelf-Confidence Booster: With clear values, we gain confidence in our decisions, knowing they align with our deepest beliefs.\n\nUnraveling Your Core Values: A Six-Step Guide\n\nList Potential Values: Begin by jotting down values that resonate with you from a given list or those that spontaneously come to mind.\n\nSeek Inspiration from Admired Individuals: The qualities we admire in others often reflect our own values. List down people you admire and the values they embody.\n\nReflect on Past Experiences: Analyze pivotal moments in your life, both positive and challenging. What values were at play during those times?\n\nGroup Similar Values: By categorizing interconnected values, you can gain clarity about overarching themes in your value system.\n\nIdentify Central Themes: For each category, pinpoint a word that encapsulates the essence of the grouped values.\n\nPrioritize Your Top Values: Narrow your list to the most vital values, ideally between five and ten. Reflect on their significance and rank them.\n\nThe Impact of Recognizing Core Values\n\nThe benefits of identifying core values are manifold. Apart from offering a sense of purpose, they:\n\nAct as behavioral guides, ensuring our actions mirror our true selves.\n\nAid in decisive moments, offering a clear path that aligns with our beliefs.\n\nSimplify career choices, steering us towards vocations that resonate with our core beliefs.\n\nBolster self-confidence, as clarity in values results in conviction in actions.\n\nDeep Dive into Core Values: The Underlying Essence:\n\nThe Origin of Core Values\n\nWhile many believe that values are instilled during childhood and adolescence, it's crucial to recognize that they're also shaped by various life experiences, societal norms, cultural backgrounds, and even historical events that have indirectly influenced our upbringing.\n\nFor instance, someone growing up in a household emphasizing community and charity might place a high value on generosity. Simultaneously, someone growing up during political unrest might inherently value peace and stability.\n\nDynamic Nature of Core Values\n\nAs we evolve, so do our core values. Life's transformative events, like becoming a parent, facing financial hardships, or even traveling and experiencing different cultures, can cause shifts in what we hold dear. Periodic reflection is essential to ensure our values align with our current self.\n\nThe Interplay between Personal and Professional Values\n\nIt's a common misconception that personal and professional values are distinct. In reality, our core values influence every sphere of our lives. A person who values integrity in their personal life will likely uphold the same professionally, emphasizing honesty in business dealings or transparency in leadership.\n\nChallenges in Living by Your Core Values\n\nWhile understanding our values is one thing, consistently living by them can be challenging. External pressures, societal expectations, or personal ambitions can sometimes blur our value-driven clarity. It's essential to recognize these moments of divergence and recalibrate.\n\nTip: When faced with a challenging decision, envision a scale with your core values on one side and the decision's immediate benefits on the other. Which weighs more? This visualization can provide clarity.\n\nNurturing a Value-Centric Environment\n\nFor those in leadership positions or with influence over community spaces, fostering environments where core values are recognized and respected is vital. This can be achieved by:\n\nOpen Dialogues: Encourage discussions where individuals can express their values, leading to mutual respect and understanding.\n\nValue-based Initiatives: Organize events or workshops that align with shared community or organizational values.\n\nWalk the Talk: Leaders should exemplify the values they preach, setting a benchmark for others.\n\nCore Values and Mental Well-being\n\nA life misaligned with one's core values can lead to feelings of unrest, dissatisfaction, and even mental health challenges. When we act against our values, it creates internal turmoil. Recognizing and addressing such mismatches is essential for holistic well-being.\n\nExample: If 'family' ranks high in your values, but you find yourself consistently prioritizing work, it might lead to stress and guilt. A re-evaluation and realignment of priorities could bring much-needed peace.\n\nFinal Reflections\n\nIn the ever-evolving tapestry of life, our core values are the steadfast threads that lend it color, pattern, and meaning. They are silent yet powerful, intangible yet palpable. By regularly revisiting and honoring these values, we enrich our lives and positively impact those around us. Embrace them, nurture them, and let them guide you towards a life of authenticity and fulfillment.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQs in the comment section below:\n\nHave you ever encountered a moment in life where understanding your core values drastically influenced or changed a decision you were about to make?

Click below.\nThe Power of Extracurriculars and Sports in College Admissions\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nNavigating Extracurriculars in College Admissions - An In-Depth Exploration:\n\nWelcome to the complex tapestry of college admissions, where every thread weaves a unique story. While the pillars of grades and test scores remain, the shimmering threads of extracurriculars can significantly enhance the overall design. Let's take a closer, more nuanced look.\n\n1. Beyond Academic Merit – The Holistic Paradigm:\n\nHigh school isn't merely an academic proving ground. It's a crucible where characters are forged. Extracurricular engagements become the outlets for students to explore passions, hone life skills, and develop dimensions of their personalities that classroom metrics can't capture.\n\nStrategies for Building an Impactful Extracurricular Narrative:\n\na. School-Sponsored Activities: Dive deeper than just joining. Take an active role. If you're gravitating towards STEM, perhaps lead a robotics team project or present in science symposiums, demonstrating both interest and aptitude.\n\nb. Community Engagement: It's about depth, not breadth. Instead of spreading yourself thinly across various projects, delve deep into a few that resonate. What did you learn? How did you lead or influence change?\n\nc. Independent Ventures: The process is as important as the product. Launching a podcast, for instance, indicates research skills, dedication, and public speaking prowess. Document your journey, your challenges, and how you overcame them.\n\nd. Athletics: A consistent commitment, despite national or state recognitions, showcases discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Highlight moments where you exemplified leadership, even if not as a designated captain.\n\ne. Work Experiences: Colleges understand the value of real-world experiences. Did you lead a project? Perhaps improved a process? These are invaluable life lessons of responsibility, time management, and more.\n\nLeadership: The Heart of the Extracurricular Narrative:\n\nActions and impact, not titles, characterize true leadership. It's about fostering team spirit, catalyzing change, and championing innovation. Colleges are eager to see how you took the initiative, faced challenges head-on, and inspired those around you.\n\nUnpacking the Transformative Power of Extracurriculars – Student Snapshots:\n\nEmma: Her journey in the art club wasn't a passive one. She introduced digital art workshops, collaborated with local artists, and secured corporate sponsorships for her charity art exhibitions. This showcased a blend of creativity, entrepreneurship, and community involvement.\n\nJason: His dedication to basketball extended to strategies for player development, organizing community engagement events, and even integrating sports psychology elements into training. Such endeavors painted him as a holistic athlete, leader, and strategist.\n\nMaya: Beyond traditional volunteering, Maya recognized a community gap and took actionable steps. She built a network of tutors, developed a scalable model, and forged partnerships with local schools, morphing her initiative from a grassroots project to a sustainable community asset.\n\nDiving Deeper into Extracurriculars: A Comprehensive Analysis for College Admissions\n\nEmbarking on the college admissions journey requires unraveling the intricate tapestry of academic achievements, personal experiences, and growth opportunities. Among these, extracurriculars emerge as pivotal components that add depth and dimension to an application. Let's further dissect their nuanced importance.\n\n2. Contextualizing Extracurricular Activities:\n\nExtracurriculars aren't standalone events in a student's life. When contextualized, they're interconnected experiences that offer insights into a student's evolution. How has a student grown from these activities? How do they relate to their future aspirations? Understanding and showcasing this evolution becomes paramount.\n\nTailored Strategies for a Robust Extracurricular Portfolio:\n\na. Integration with Academic Interests: Aligning extracurriculars with academic interests can showcase consistency in your passions. A student interested in environmental science might consider leading eco-friendly initiatives at school or joining a local conservation group.\n\nb. Global and Local Perspectives: Engage in activities within your community and beyond. A stint with an international exchange program or a global online seminar series can add a worldly perspective.\n\nc. Digital Presence: In today's digital age, maintaining a blog, a YouTube channel, or even a dedicated Instagram page about your extracurricular journey can be beneficial. It offers tangible proof of your commitment and allows colleges a firsthand view of your journey.\n\nd. Collaborations and Networking: How have you utilized your extracurriculars to build a network? Did you collaborate with professionals, other schools, or organizations? Such efforts showcase proactive initiative and resourcefulness.\n\ne. Continuous Learning: Highlight any additional courses or certifications you pursued to excel in your chosen extracurricular area. This shows dedication to honing your craft.\n\nThe Nuances of Leadership and Its Far-Reaching Impacts:\n\nLeadership in extracurriculars also encompasses adaptability, conflict resolution, and strategic foresight. Reflect on challenges: Were disagreements in the debate club or budgetary constraints in a community project? How did you navigate them? These narratives can be as impactful as the leadership roles themselves.\n\nSpotlighting the Multi-dimensional Impact of Extracurriculars – Delving Further:\n\nEmma: Apart from her endeavors in the art realm, Emma used her skills to create art therapy workshops for local mental health clinics, establishing a nexus between art, health, and community service.\n\nJason: Supplementing his on-court skills, Jason organized seminars on sports nutrition and mental well-being for athletes, emphasizing a holistic approach to sports.\n\nMaya: Maya's non-profit journey was enriched by attending grant writing workshops and collaborating with educational experts, ensuring her initiative had depth and breadth.\n\nc. Independent Activities: Unleashing Your Creativity \n\nPursuing independent extracurricular activities, such as specialized online courses, hobbies, starting a small business, or hosting an online podcast, exemplifies your curiosity, self-motivation, and willingness to learn beyond the confines of the classroom. Such endeavors demonstrate your creativity and determination to carve your unique path.\n\nd. Sports: Building Character and Teamwork \n\nParticipating in sports fosters essential life skills, such as discipline, teamwork, time management, and resilience. It is about athletic prowess, personal growth, and character development. Whether you excel in team sports like soccer or basketball or thrive in individual pursuits like tennis or swimming, colleges value the dedication and values cultivated through sports involvement.\n\ne. Work Experience: Developing Valuable Career Skills \n\nEmbracing work experiences, whether in part-time jobs, internships, or freelance work, portrays your maturity, time management abilities, and commitment to building crucial job skills. Additionally, work commitments instill valuable traits such as responsibility, work ethic, and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n3. Getting Started with Extracurricular Activities: \n\nThe Sooner, the Better The ideal time to embark on your extracurricular journey is as early as possible in high school. Long-term engagement in a particular activity can lead to leadership opportunities, which hold significant weight in the eyes of college admissions committees. However, it is never too late to take the plunge, even if you have not explored extracurriculars.\n\na. Finding the Right Activities: Discover suitable clubs or groups by seeking recommendations from friends, exploring your school's website, connecting with local organizations, or exploring online courses and community college programs.\n\nb. Personal Factors to Consider: When choosing extracurriculars, align them with your potential career paths, intended college major or minor, and any existing passions or hobbies that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\nc. Start Your Own Venture: If you cannot find an existing activity that resonates with your interests, consider starting your own club, group, or business. Such entrepreneurial spirit showcases leadership and innovation, qualities that college admissions committees highly value.\n\nConclusion: \n\nAs we conclude this exploration into the transformative power of extracurricular activities and sports in college admissions, I encourage you to embrace the opportunities that lie before you. Participate wholeheartedly, explore your passions, and let your extracurricular journey define the remarkable person you are becoming. \n\nRemember, it is about achieving academic excellence and showcasing your unique character, leadership potential, and dedication to making a difference in the world. Your extracurricular pursuits will set you apart on your path to elite colleges and propel you toward a future filled with success and fulfillment. The world is your canvas; now, go and paint your masterpiece!\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQs in the comment section below:\n\nHow can students balance following their passions and strategically selecting extracurriculars that resonate with their college aspirations?\n\nHow do you believe the past two years, given global events and shifts in traditional education models, have redefined the significance and approach towards extracurricular activities?\n\nRemember, as you sculpt your college application, each extracurricular is a chisel mark, refining the masterpiece that is your holistic student profile.

    "url": "https://247teach.org/blog/2019/5/23/homeschooling-for-beginners-a-start-up-guide-5rl7b-8jpej",

Anyone from a child to an adult uses at least one social media platform to stay updated and communicate with friends and family.  In fact, 3.2 billion people use social media, which equates to about 42 percent of the population.\n\nSocial media is very prevalent in this day and age.\n\nWith such a large amount of people using social media, there is plenty of information cycling through these platforms. However, much of this information is quite negative. Forty-one percent of teenagers claimed they had a negative experience while using a social media site. Another 88 percent -- a very staggering number -- have seen someone be mean or cruel on social media.\n\nWith all that being said, how can teenagers stay safe and use social media in a positive way? What happens if they do not?\n\nPositive Digital Citizenship\n\nThe key to maintaining positivity on social media sites is to develop the idea of positive digital citizenship. This term is defined as follows: “treating others with respect in online spaces and never cyberbullying.”\n\nPositive digital citizenship goes much beyond that basic definition. It also involves making appropriate decisions when communicating with others; refraining from stealing someone else’s digital work; and protecting personal information.\n\nPersonally, I believe in being a positive digital citizen by complimenting others and spreading positive messages. I am part of an organization that works to empower collegiate women through writing. In this organization, they spread uplifting and inspiring messages on their social media accounts that call on people to take steps towards a more fulfilling life.\n\nI choose to relay those messages to others in hopes of creating a more positive community on social media. By doing so, it spreads joy to others and gives them a more optimistic outlook.  Additionally, if someone disagrees with me on a topic, I simply ignore the comment or respond in a factual manner. There is no need to add any fuel to the fire, so to speak.\n\nBe positive online and offline.\n\nTeenagers can begin to implement this idea by thinking about what they are posting and how it would affect someone. Parents can also weigh in on their child’s safety by displaying positive actions for their children to follow.  The model of digital citizenship plays off of citizenship in general. Think of how you treat people offline and in the real world. Then proceed to do the same online.\n\nCyberbullying\n\nCyberbullying has grown in recent years. In fact, 70 percent of teenagers have reported seeing bullying online. This negative phenomenon leads to many devastating results but can be combated in several ways.One way to combat cyberbullying is to continuously promote the idea of positive digital citizenship. Posting positive messages instead of negative ones can boost morale. \n\nAdditionally, parents can spot signs of cyberbullying and put a stop to it before going too far. If their child or teen noticeably decreases their device use, shuts down social media sites, or withdraws from social situations, it may be time to step in.  Parents should talk to their children or teenagers about their concerns, document harmful comments or posts, and report them to social media sites or to a school.\n\nStereotyping\n\nHarvard University rescinded a student’s admission.\n\nThe concept of stereotyping goes hand-in-hand with cyberbullying. A bully might stereotype an individual or group of individuals based on race or gender. They may proceed to post negative comments or posts on this group. In fact, just recently, a controversy ignited in the political realm on racist comments made by a high school student from Parkland, Florida. This student, a survivor of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, grew to prominence as a conservative activist to improve school safety measures.  The student repeatedly used the n-word in private chats and Google documents used for academic purposes. When the news came to light, the student was forced to apologized publicly on Twitter, but this came with a major cost: his admission to Harvard was rescinded.  There were many responses to this ordeal, but the common consensus was that Harvard worked proactively and swiftly in rescinding the student’s admission. Don’t let this be you!\n\n\nConsequences of negative digital citizenship\n\nThis event demonstrates the drastic consequences put into effect when a teenager engages in negative digital citizenship. Although a major case, it brought forth new perspectives and rules for staying safe online. Further outcomes could include arresting an individual for cyberbullying or imposing a fine. In cases such as the student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it might be rescinding an admission or removing a student from a school.  This controversy will negatively affect the rest of that student’s life, as well as anyone who chooses to engage in negative digital citizenship. He will have a very difficult time running for office, if he chooses, and has unlikely chances of getting a job.\n\nWith one negative comment or social media post, a teen might be in big trouble. Parents would have to witness the consequences of their child’s actions and feel immense pain.  Additionally, as someone who knows mutual friends of that student, I saw first hand how friendships were affected and how many students were left surprised and disappointed by the controversy’s outcome.  Maintaining a positive image online is crucial to ensure the safety of your child or teenager when using social media. Positive digital citizenship will set a teenager on the path to success in the future. \n\nTo get more familiarized with safe social networking and the concept of digital citizenship, 24/7 Learning Academy offers an extensive course covering these topics and more.

Click below.\nHow to Write Engaging Essays and Answer Short Answer Questions Effectively\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nWriting an essay or answering short answer questions is a fundamental skill required in many academic and professional settings. Whether you are writing an essay for a school assignment or answering questions as part of a job application, it is essential to understand the best practices for writing clear and concise responses.\n\n7 Steps to effective Essay Writing:\n\nChoose a clear and concise topic and understand the purpose of your writing: The first step in writing a successful essay is choosing a topic that is both interesting and relevant. When selecting a topic, consider the purpose of the essay, the audience you are writing for, and your interests. If a topic is already chosen for you, you must also know the essay's purpose and how it is expected to create value for the reader.\n\nResearch the topic thoroughly: Once you have selected a topic, it is important to research it thoroughly. This means gathering information from reliable sources, such as books, articles, and academic journals. Be sure to take detailed notes and organize the information you gather in a way that is easy to understand and reference.\n\nCreate an outline: Before you start writing, it is a good idea to create an outline. This will help you organize your thoughts and ideas, and ensure that your essay has a clear structure. Your outline should include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\n\nWrite an introduction: The introduction is the first thing that your audience will read, so it is important to make a solid first impression. Start with a hook that captures their attention and provides background information that sets the stage for the rest of the essay. Be sure to include a thesis statement, which states the main argument of your essay.\n\nDevelop body paragraphs: The body paragraphs are the heart of your essay and should support your thesis statement with relevant examples and evidence. Each body paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point and should use examples and evidence to support that point.\n\nWrite a conclusion: The conclusion is the last thing that your audience will read, so it is important to leave a lasting impression. Summarize the main points of your essay, and restate your thesis statement in a new and interesting way. End with a closing statement that ties everything together.\n\nProofread and edit: Before submitting your essay, it is crucial to proofread your essay at least three times to edit it for readability, grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Check for any inconsistencies in your argument, and make sure that your writing is clear and concise.\n\nShort-answer questions require concise and precise responses that directly address the question and are typically limited to a few sentences. On the other hand, an essay is a more in-depth written piece that presents an argument or information on a particular subject, typically ranging from several paragraphs to several pages in length. Essays provide the opportunity for more elaborate explanation and analysis, while short answer questions demand succinct and focused answers.\n\n5 Steps to answering Short Answer Questions:\n\nRead the question carefully: When answering short answer questions, it is essential to read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. Pay close attention to keywords, such as \"define,\" \"explain,\" and \"compare,\" as they will give you an idea of what type of information is required.\n\nAnswer the question concisely: Short answer questions aim to answer the question clearly and concisely, using only the information that is specifically required. Avoid adding unnecessary information or details, and stick to the point.\n\nUse clear and concise language: When writing short answer questions, it is important to use clear and concise language that is easy to understand. Use simple, straightforward sentences, and avoid using complex vocabulary or technical terms unless they are necessary.\n\nAvoid irrelevant information: When answering short-answer questions, it is important to avoid adding irrelevant information or details that do not directly answer the question. Stick to the information that is specifically required, and avoid going off on tangents.\n\nUse examples and specific details: To make your answers more exciting and engaging, it is a good idea to use examples and specific details to support your reasoning and point of view. \n\nIn conclusion, writing an essay or answering short-answer questions requires careful planning, research, and attention to detail. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can communicate your ideas effectively, demonstrate your understanding of the topic, and leave a lasting impression on your audience. Whether you are writing an essay for school or answering questions as part of a job application, taking the time to understand and follow these best practices will pay off in the end. With practice and dedication, you can develop your writing skills and become an expert at crafting clear, concise, and engaging essays and short answer responses.\n\nBonus: 6 Characteristics Every Great Writer\n\nA good writer is characterized by 6 key traits: attention to detail, discipline, clarity, a strong vocabulary, being open to changes, and a passion for reading. \n\nAttention to detail helps a writer add a special touch to their writing by noticing subtle changes around them. \n\nDiscipline and re-evaluating work help writers improve their craft. \n\nClarity enables writers to express complex thoughts and ideas in simple language. \n\nA strong vocabulary helps maintain reader interest and communicate effectively.\n\nBeing open to external edits and suggestions allows writers to improve weak points in their work. \n\nA passion for reading helps writers understand the nuts and bolts of writing, such as syntax, tone, framing, etc. Improving upon these qualities can lead to better writing skills.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

It means we take the time to think about what we want to say, why we want to say it, how we want to say it, and how to successfully communicate it. \n\nWriting with intentionality requires us to be thoughtful and intentional about every aspect of our writing. We need to consider the purpose of our writing, whether it's to inform, persuade, or entertain, and tailor our message accordingly. We must also consider our audience, who they are, what they care about, and how we can connect with them through our writing. Finally, we need to think about how we can effectively convey our message, using language, tone, and storytelling techniques that are engaging, impactful, and memorable.\n\nIn short, intentional writing means writing with purpose, clarity, and authenticity. It means thinking about what we want to say and why we want to say it and then expressing ourselves in a way that connects with our readers and makes an impact.\n\nWriting is an essential tool that helps us communicate our thoughts, ideas, and emotions with others. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a creative writer, it's crucial to write intentionally. Writing with intentionality means being deliberate and purposeful in your writing.

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of writing with intentionality and how to do it effectively.\n\nWhy Writing with Intentionality Is Important:\n\nWriting with intentionality is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it ensures that your writing has a clear purpose and message. When you write with intentionality, you know exactly what you want to say and why you want to say it. This makes it easier for your readers to understand and connect with your writing.\n\nSecondly, writing with intentionality helps you connect with your audience.

Knowing your audience will help you tailor your message to their needs and interests. This will make your writing more engaging and relevant.\n\nChoose your voice: Your writing voice is the way you express yourself through your writing. Choose a voice that is authentic and reflective of your personality. This will help you connect with your readers and make your writing more memorable.\n\nUse storytelling techniques: Stories are powerful tools for engaging and connecting with your audience. Use storytelling techniques such as vivid descriptions, dialogue, and narrative arcs to bring your message to life.\n\nEdit and revise: Once you've written your first draft, take the time to edit and revise your writing. Look for ways to make your message clearer, more concise, and more impactful. This will help you create writing that is polished and effective.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWriting with intentionality is essential for creating engaging, effective, and memorable writing.

Click below.\nUnlock Your Learning Potential: The Art of Effective Note-Taking and the Best Note-Taking Formats\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nNote-taking is a critical aspect of learning and an essential skill for students and professionals alike. The process of taking notes helps you to focus, retain information, and organize your thoughts. Effective note-taking requires more than just writing down information verbatim. Instead, it requires careful consideration of the information presented and active engagement with the material. This blog post will explore how to take practical notes that support deep learning and discuss the most effective note-taking formats.\n\nWhy is note-taking important?\n\nNote-taking is an essential tool for learning because it helps you to process and retain information. When you take notes, you actively engage with the material, enhancing your understanding of the subject. Also, taking notes helps you identify the most critical information and prioritize learning. When you review your notes later, they serve as helpful references and can help you to remember the material more easily.\n\nHow to take practical notes?\n\nTaking effective notes requires a combination of attention, focus, and organization. Here are some tips for taking useful notes:\n\nPay attention and be an active listener: The key to taking effective notes is to pay attention to the information presented. This means being an active listener and engaging with the material by asking questions and summarizing information.\n\nSimplify and condense information: When taking notes, it is essential to simplify and condense the information, not by writing down everything verbatim but only focusing on the main ideas and key concepts.\n\nUse abbreviations and symbols: Abbreviations and symbols can help you to condense your notes and save time. However, be sure to use abbreviations and symbols that are easy to understand and remember.\n\nOrganize your notes: Effective note-taking requires organization. This means using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and other organizational tools to structure your notes and make them easier to read and review.\n\nPersonalize your note-taking style: There is no one right way to take notes. Instead, you should find a note-taking technique that works best for you and stick with it. This could mean using a combination of different note-taking formats, such as bullet points and mind maps.\n\nMost effective note-taking formats:\n\nCornell Method: The Cornell Method is a popular note-taking format that divides your paper into three sections: a note-taking section, a summary section, and a cue column. The note-taking section is where you write down information verbatim. The summary section condenses the information. In the cue column, you write keywords or questions to help you review the material later.\n\nOutline Format: The Outline Format is a straightforward note-taking format that involves using headings and subheadings to structure your notes. This format is particularly useful for lectures and presentations that follow a clear structure.\n\nMind Maps: Mind Maps are a visual note-taking format that involves creating a diagram of interconnected ideas and concepts. Mind maps are an effective way to connect related ideas and help you to see the big picture.\n\nChart Format: The Chart Format involves using tables or charts to organize your notes. This format helps organize information that is numerical or involves comparisons.\n\nGraphical Format: The Graphical Format uses visual elements, such as diagrams and sketches, to represent information. This format is particularly useful for subjects that involve spatial relationships, such as science and engineering.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, taking effective notes is a valuable tool for enhancing your learning and retaining information. Whether you are a student or a professional, taking practical notes can help you stay organized and focused and provide a valuable reference for future use. With the tips and formats outlined in this blog post, you can develop a note-taking strategy that best supports your learning goals. Remember, taking effective notes is not just about writing down information verbatim but about actively engaging with the material, simplifying and condensing information, and organizing your thoughts. So, take the time to find a note-taking format that works for you and start using it today – you'll be amazed at the difference it can make in your learning and retention.\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nGrowing Self-Confidence in your Teens - Empowering Their Future Success\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nCultivating Self-Confidence in Your Teens for a Brighter Tomorrow:\n\nSelf-confidence is the backbone of every success story, a catalyst that propels individuals toward their goals. For teenagers, an age rife with self-discovery and transformation, this trait becomes particularly pivotal. As a Teen Leadership Coach, I’ve delved deep into the heart of adolescent development and have come to recognize that the power of self-confidence in teens can truly change trajectories. Let’s dive in.\n\n1. Understanding Teenage Self-Confidence: More than Just Self-esteem\n\nWhile often used interchangeably, self-confidence and self-esteem are distinct. Self-esteem revolves around one’s worth and value, while self-confidence focuses on trust in one’s abilities. For teens, building this trust is imperative. It’s not about being infallible; it's about believing they can overcome challenges and learn from mistakes. A teen who harnesses this trust is well-equipped to navigate the rollercoaster of adolescence.\n\n2. Boosting Academic Achievements\n\nA confident teen approaches academics with a positive mindset. They believe they can grasp concepts, ask questions, and challenge ideas. This proactive stance not only enhances their learning experience but often translates to better grades and heightened intellectual curiosity.\n\n3. Fostering Resilience in Adversity\n\nLife is unpredictable, and setbacks are inevitable. Self-confidence imbues teens with resilience. They view failures as feedback, not as dead-ends. This perspective allows them to rebound from adversities, be it a low test score, a sports defeat, or a personal setback, with greater vigor.\n\n4. Enhancing Social Interactions\n\nFor many teens, social scenarios can be daunting. But with self-confidence, they can approach situations, from group projects to new friendships, with assurance. This poise enhances their communication skills, aids in conflict resolution, and fosters meaningful connections.\n\n5. Encouraging Leadership Endeavors\n\nLeadership is not exclusive to the loud or domineering. True leadership springs from confidence in one's values and abilities. Confident teens often step up, spearhead initiatives, and inspire peers. Their assurance in their vision makes them compelling leaders.\n\n6. Cultivating a Growth Mindset\n\nTeens with self-confidence are not deterred by the unfamiliar. They embrace challenges and see them as opportunities to learn and grow. This growth mindset propels them towards novel experiences, be it trying a new sport, learning a musical instrument, or exploring an academic interest.\n\n7. Reducing Vulnerability to Peer Pressure\n\nA confident teen stands firm in their beliefs and values. Their inner strength acts as a shield, reducing their susceptibility to peer pressure. Instead of conforming for the sake of fit, they make choices aligned with their true selves.\n\n8. Building a Foundation for Future Success\n\nThe adolescent years lay the foundation for future endeavors. With self-confidence, teens develop a can-do attitude. This outlook, coupled with their skills and passion, sets them on a path of success, be it in higher education, career choices, or personal ventures.\n\n9. Enabling Authentic Self-expression\n\nSelf-confidence encourages teens to embrace their unique identity in a world that often dictates how one should look, think, or act. They find the courage to express their opinions, showcase their talents, and be unapologetically themselves.\n\n10. Igniting a Passion for Lifelong Learning\n\nIn a rapidly evolving world, the ability to learn and adapt becomes crucial. Self-confidence acts as the torchbearer for a teen’s journey into lifelong learning. Confident teens approach new information with enthusiasm and curiosity. They're not afraid to ask questions, seek answers, and immerse themselves in the vast ocean of knowledge.\n\n11. Bolstering Decision-Making Skills\n\nEveryday life is riddled with decisions, some trivial and some transformative. Teens equipped with self-confidence evaluate options with clarity. They trust their judgment, reflect on possible outcomes, and make decisions that resonate with their goals and values.\n\n12. Enhancing Creativity and Innovation\n\nSelf-confidence is the wind beneath the wings of creativity. When teens believe in themselves, they’re more likely to venture outside the box, think differently, and come up with innovative solutions. This creative prowess is a valuable asset in both academic and extracurricular pursuits.\n\n13. Setting Boundaries and Advocating for Themselves\n\nConfident teens recognize their worth. They set healthy boundaries, stand up against injustices, and advocate for their needs and rights. This self-advocacy ensures they cultivate relationships and environments conducive to their growth.\n\n14. Building Momentum for Future Challenges\n\nEvery achievement, big or small, fuels the fire of self-confidence. As teens overcome challenges, they gain momentum for future hurdles. This cumulative confidence ensures they approach life with optimism, resilience, and an unyielding spirit.\n\nFinal Words\n\nSelf-confidence is not a destination but a journey. It's an ever-evolving trait that gets honed with every experience. As guides in our teens' life, our role is to provide the right tools, encouragement, and environment to let this confidence blossom. In doing so, we're not just raising teenagers; we're nurturing future leaders, innovators, and champions of their own destinies.\n\nBy emphasizing the importance of self-confidence and understanding its multifaceted benefits, we can better support and champion our teens' growth into confident adults.

Click below: \nLesson 4: Quizzing or Retrieval Practice\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWorkshop Scenario:\nPlease think of yourself in the following scenario as you complete this workshop. \n\nImagine you are a learner struggling to keep up with coursework. You are overwhelmed by the amount of material you need to learn and find yourself forgetting key concepts and details. Determined to improve your study habits, you enroll in a learning and studying techniques workshop. In that workshop, you learn about several excellent study techniques. \n\nYour final assignment is to choose a study technique to research and prepare to debate why you think that study technique is the best. Also, provide an example of how you used the study technique in your own life. \n\nIn the last lesson, you learned about the interleaving study technique. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about retrieval practice. \n\nRemember to take notes on the pros and cons of retrieval practice. You will need to choose one of the study routines to debate later.\n\nLearning Objectives \nBy the end of this lesson, learners will be able to…\n\nUnderstand the definition of quizzing and retrieval practice \n\nExplain the benefits of quizzing and retrieval practice for long-term memory\n\nCreate a personalized study routine by applying these two study techniques\n\nImportant Questions to Answer While Reading \nTo be successful in this lesson, you must be able to answer these important questions. \n\nWhat is quizzing or retrieval practice?\n\nWhat are some ways to incorporate retrieval practice into your study routine?\n\nLesson 4: Quizzing or Retrieval Practice\nWhat is quizzing or retrieval practice?\n\nQuizzing, also known as retrieval practice, is a learning technique that involves recalling information from memory, typically through questions or practice tests. Retrieval practice is based on the idea that actively recalling information from memory helps to strengthen and reinforce memory traces, leading to improved retention of information over time.\n\nBenefits of regular testing\n\nImproved memory retention: Improved memory retention refers to the ability to better store and retrieve information from memory over time. This is an essential outcome of effective learning and is often a goal of using study techniques and strategies. By using techniques like active recall, chunking, mnemonic devices, and others, learners can strengthen the neural connections in their brains, leading to more efficient and effective memory storage and retrieval. Improved memory retention can lead to better exam performance, enhanced problem-solving skills, and increased confidence in one's abilities.\n\nEnhanced self-awareness: Retrieval practice or quizzing can enhance self-awareness by highlighting areas where learners may need to improve their understanding or knowledge. When learners attempt to retrieve information from memory, they may discover gaps in their ability or understanding that they were previously unaware of. This can help them to identify areas where they need to focus their study efforts and improve their overall learning outcomes. Additionally, by practicing self-quizzing or using other retrieval techniques, learners can better understand what they know and don't know, which can help them set more realistic goals and expectations for their learning.\n\nIncreased motivation: Retrieval practice, or quizzing, can increase motivation for some learners. When students engage in retrieval practice, they receive feedback on what they know and what they still need to learn. This can help to motivate them to continue studying and working to improve their understanding of the material. Additionally, incorporating growth mindset principles, such as viewing mistakes as opportunities for learning and embracing challenges, can help to increase motivation and foster a love of learning.\n\nImproved problem-solving skills: Retrieval practice and interleaving are two study techniques that enhance problem-solving skills. Retrieval practice strengthens memory recall, making retrieving and applying the information to new situations easier. Interleaving promotes flexible thinking and helps learners better understand how different concepts or skills relate to each other, which can enhance problem-solving skills for complex or unfamiliar problems. Additionally, choosing a growth mindset can help learners view challenges and obstacles as opportunities for learning and growth, leading to more effective problem-solving approaches.\n\nBetter performance on exams: Regular testing through quizzing or retrieval practice has improved performance on exams. When information is actively retrieved from memory, it is more likely to be retained over time, which can help to better prepare for exams. Additionally, practicing problem-solving skills through techniques such as interleaving and active recall can enhance the ability to apply knowledge in new and unfamiliar situations, which can be especially valuable on exams where unexpected or challenging questions may be presented.\n\nWays to incorporate retrieval practice into your study routine\n\nSelf-quizzing: Self-quizzing is a retrieval practice technique where you ask yourself questions about a particular topic, attempting to recall the information from memory without looking at any notes or resources. This technique helps to strengthen and reinforce memory traces, leading to improved retention of information over time. Self-quizzing can be done using flashcards or simply asking yourself questions about the material you have studied.\n\nFlashcards: Flashcards are a study tool to enhance learning and memory retention. They usually consist of a question or prompt on one side of the card and the corresponding answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to practice a wide range of subjects, from vocabulary to mathematical formulas, and can be an effective method for learning and memorizing information through active recall. Creating flashcards can also be helpful, as it involves summarizing and synthesizing information and identifying key concepts and details.\n\nPractice exams: Practice exams are a form of retrieval practice that can help students prepare for exams by testing their knowledge and understanding of a particular subject or topic. Students or instructors can create practice exams. By taking practice exams, students can identify areas where they need to improve their knowledge or skills and become familiar with the format and style of questions they may encounter on the exam. This can help to reduce test anxiety and improve performance on the exam. Additionally, practice exams can reinforce the concepts and information learned through other study techniques, such as active recall and mnemonics.\n\nPeer Review: Peer review is a technique in which you have a study group or a partner with whom you can discuss and review the materials you are studying. You can ask each other questions, share knowledge, and provide feedback, which can help you identify gaps in your understanding and clarify concepts. Peer review can also help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills and provide a supportive learning environment.\n\nClosing Assessment:\n\nNow that you have reached the end of this lesson, you should know the following:\n\nUnderstand the benefits of regular testing, retrieval practice and tools or techniques can be used for self-quizzing or practice testing.\n\nCOMPLETE THE LESSON 4 ASSESSMENT\nAdvance your understanding: \n\nPlease answer the following questions in the comment section below and interact with learners from around the world.\n\nHow can retrieval be used to promote long-term retention of information compared to other learning techniques?\n\nPlease read and reply to other learners’ answers in the forum by stating if you agree or disagree with their answers and why. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. \n\nLesson 3: Interleaving or Mixed Practice\nLesson 5:  Study Techniques, Mindsets, and Final Workshop\nHave questions?

Click below.\nCrafting an Unbeatable UX/UI Case Study for Your Design Portfolio\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nCreating a Compelling UX/UI Case Study\nIntroduction:\n\nYou've poured your heart into your designs. You've spent countless hours tinkering with UI elements and going through numerous iterations of your UX processes. Now, how do you showcase this plethora of skills and experiences in a way that tells a compelling story and lands you the job you're aiming for? Enter the UX/UI case study—a pivotal piece of your design portfolio that can set you apart in a sea of candidates.\n\nContrary to popular belief, crafting a compelling case study is not just about showing off your final product. It's about storytelling—intertwining the tale of the design problem you solved with your personal journey through the design process. Let's dive in.\n\nSetting the Stage: Your Portfolio Persona and Context:\n\nBefore you even start writing, consider who will read your case study. Often, a recruiter or hiring manager is looking for specific skills, years of experience, and industry keywords in a tight time frame. You don't just need to catch their eye—you need to hold their attention.\n\nAlso, provide a snapshot of the project context. Answer questions like what industry your project is in, what challenges it addresses, and what your role was. Give credit to team members if it was a collaborative effort. This can offer a multi-dimensional understanding of your capabilities and contributions.\n\nStructure Your Story: Break Away from the Norm:\n\nThe temptation to follow a conventional structure—starting with the problem, then discussing the user journey, sketches, and finally, the results—is vital. But to stand out, consider the main points you want to convey and tailor your structure accordingly.\n\nHere's a simple outline to consider:\n\nBackground and Context\n\nProblem Statement\n\nYour Unique Approach\n\nKey Design Elements\n\nResults and Impact\n\nNext Steps and Learnings\n\nBackground and Context:\n\nStart by establishing the stage for your design story. Mention your company, the problem the project aims to solve, your role, the tools you used, and key project outcomes. This will help readers to immerse themselves in the narrative.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nGo beyond merely stating the problem—make a compelling case for its existence. Did you conduct competitor analyses or market research? Share snippets or visuals to add credibility to your story.\n\nYour Unique Approach:\n\nNow it's time to strut your stuff. What makes you different from every other designer? This is the part where you explain your design process in a way that highlights your strengths and specialties. Maybe you excel at user research or have a knack for UI animation. Whatever it is, now's your time to shine.\n\nKey Design Elements:\n\nHighlight key design elements that had a significant impact on the project. While providing a comprehensive view is good, make sure you focus on quality over quantity. Your reader is likely scanning, not reading in detail.\n\nResults and Impact:\n\nResults talk. If you can, share metrics that prove the success of your project. If not, discuss the KPIs you would monitor if given a chance. Remember, this section isn't just a pat on your own back—it demonstrates to prospective employers that you understand the bigger picture.\n\nNext Steps and Learnings:\n\nClose with what you've learned and what you'd change or wish to explore further. This adds a layer of depth to your process, revealing your capacity for self-assessment and growth.\n\nVisual Elements: The Make or Break:\n\nVisuals are non-negotiable. They not only make your case study aesthetically pleasing but also make it easier to digest. Use high-quality images, videos, or interactive elements to breathe life into your story. When it comes to presentation, remember that sometimes you might need to spend an equal amount of time perfecting how your project looks in the case study as you did while working on it.\n\nAdditional Tips for Elevating Your Case Study:\n\n1. Master the Art of Scannability\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, your readers—especially hiring managers and recruiters—are most likely scanning through your case study. Use headers, bullet points, and varying text sizes to make your case study easy on the eyes and quick to read.\n\n2. Showcase Collaborative Skills\n\nIf your project was a team effort, mention your role clearly and give credit where it's due. Demonstrating that you can collaborate effectively is just as important as showcasing your skills.\n\n3. Embed Interactive Elements\n\nConsider including GIFs, videos, or interactive prototypes to demonstrate user flows or animations. These elements can better explain your design decisions and show your skills.\n\n4. Reviews and Testimonials\n\nIf the project succeeds, reviews or testimonials from stakeholders, team members, or end-users can validate your contributions. They add a layer of credibility that data alone might not provide.\n\n5. Proofread and Iterate\n\nA case study with typos or grammatical errors can undermine the professional impression you're trying to create. Review your text thoroughly and, if possible, get feedback from industry peers or mentors. Take their suggestions seriously and iterate.\n\n6. Make It Shareable\n\nConsider adding social sharing buttons at the end of your case study, especially if it's hosted on an online portfolio. The easier you make it for others to share your work, the more exposure you will get.\n\n7. Update Periodically\n\nYour learning doesn't stop when the project is done, nor should your case study. Update it with new metrics, feedback, or subsequent phases of the project to show its evolution and your ongoing commitment to improvement.\n\nPitfalls to Avoid:\n\n1. Overcomplicating Things\n\nWhile you may be tempted to include all the nitty-gritty details of your project, less is often more. Please keep it simple and focus on the most impactful aspects of your work.\n\n2. Being Too Self-Centered\n\nThe case study should demonstrate your skills and highlight the project's goals, the problems solved, and the team's efforts. Striking a balance between \"I\" and \"we\" is crucial.\n\n3. Skipping the User's Perspective\n\nThe heart of UX/UI design is solving problems for real people. Make sure your case study doesn't neglect the human element. Discuss user feedback, how you used it, and the resultant modifications to your designs.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nYour case study is a powerful tool in your portfolio that can do much more than showcase your past work. It provides a narrative, offers insights into your process, and, when done right, tells a compelling story that sets you apart from the competition. Please don't underestimate the effort it requires; give it the time and attention it deserves. It's your design story, after all—make sure it's great.\n\nFor those interested in taking their UX/UI portfolio to the next level, don't miss our curated list of resources to help refine your skills and presentation techniques.\n\nEmpower your child to master digital design and pave their way to becoming the future's leading architects of user experience.

Here's the Reality\n\nBy Anthony Miller\n\nLead Instructional Designer  \n\nPrefer to listen to this post? Click below.\nCan You Become an Instructional Designer in Just 10 Weeks? Here's the Reality\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nAs a Teacher, can you become an instructional designer in 10 weeks, yes or no?\nIntroduction\n\nYou're not alone if you've ever pondered the question, \"Can I learn instructional design and get hired in 10 weeks?\". The field of instructional design is gaining significant traction, and many are contemplating a transition into this evolving discipline. The answer to that question is a mixed bag — yes, it is possible, but highly unlikely, even for experienced teachers. Let's dive into the complexities of venturing into instructional design, especially for those coming from a teaching background.\n\nThe Paradigm Shift\n\nSwitching to instructional design from a teaching profession does involve an overlap in skill sets, but it's not a straightforward transition. While teachers are implementors of learning, instructional designers are the architects of learning. This shift demands the development of new competencies like visual design, understanding authoring tools, navigating learning management systems, research and analysis, and a plethora of soft skills not regularly practiced in the classroom. The equation to remember here is simple: knowledge + practice + time = experience.\n\nIs It Hard to Get into Instructional Design?\n\nThe path to becoming an instructional designer can be direct or indirect, and each has challenges and opportunities. According to industry reports, landing an instructional design role without relevant experience can be a steep climb but is not impossible.\n\nThe Direct Path: Master's Degree or Certificate\n\nThe most straightforward way to enter the field is to earn a master's degree or certificate in instructional design. This formal education provides a strong foundation, particularly for those who do not have previous education or training experience. However, based on our experience, many master's degree programs do not offer practical opportunities to apply the knowledge gained, which is essential to gain the real experience required to get hired. Additionally, some certificate programs focus mainly on teaching the authoring tools without providing access to the theory and soft skills training necessary for a successful transition. Nonetheless, some graduates find rewarding roles even without prior work experience.\n\nThe Indirect Path: Self-Learning\n\nThen, there's the indirect path, where you learn the ropes independently. This route is usually slower and more complex, especially if you lack a formal portfolio or credentials. However, dedicated self-learners can succeed, especially if they tap into online resources like blogs, webinars, and LinkedIn posts.\n\nSomething In Between: Bootcamps and Academies\n\nA middle-ground option exists in the form of bootcamps or academies. These short-term courses offer an accelerated learning curve. To explore this further, consider joining 24/7 Teach's Instructional Design Bootcamp with Job Guarantee.\n\nWhat Does It Take to Be an Instructional Designer?\n\nBeing effective in this field goes beyond just acing interviews. It's about practical skills, experiences, and the impact you make. For teachers transitioning into this field, understand that the first few years are crucial. Just like it often takes at least three years in the classroom to become proficient as a teacher, a similar investment of time and experience is essential for instructional designers.\n\nThe Teacher's Advantage\n\nIf you're already involved in education, you have an edge. You're familiar with curriculum planning, lesson execution, and the nuances of pedagogy. These transferable skills give you a headstart in the instructional design landscape. Yet, as a teacher, you might wonder, do I just need a portfolio to become an instructional designer? Well, a portfolio is vital but not the end-all-be-all. The key is to continuously hone your skills to become an effective instructional designer who gets hired every time.\n\nReal-Life Case Study: From Teacher to Instructional Designer\n\nLet's talk about Rob, a teacher who transitioned into instructional design through our boot camp program. Rob didn't even have a portfolio when he entered the program. Fast forward to today, he has received three job offers in the field. His experience demonstrates the transformative power of dedicated learning and skill acquisition.\n\nIs Being an Instructional Designer Worth It?\n\nYes, the investment is worthwhile. The field offers room for creativity, technical growth, and the satisfaction of having a tangible impact on learning outcomes. The compensation is also competitive, making it a lucrative career path.\n\nSkill Set Essentials for Instructional Designers\n\nNow that we've covered the basics, let's delve deeper into your skill sets to excel as an instructional designer.\n\nTechnical Skills:\n\nAuthoring Tools: Familiarity with software like Adobe Captivate, Articulate Storyline, Synthesia, and ChatGPT is essential. These tools help in the creation of digital learning materials.\n\nLearning Management Systems (LMS): Platforms like Moodle, Blackboard, and TalentLMS are commonly used to host online courses. A working knowledge of LMS is vital for launching and tracking learning programs.\n\nGraphic Design: While you don't need to be a graphic designer, familiarity with Photoshop or Illustrator can be beneficial.\n\nHTML/CSS: Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is advantageous as it enables you to modify course materials without relying on a developer.\n\nSoft Skills\n\nCommunication: Effective verbal and written communication skills are crucial. You'll often need to collaborate with subject matter experts, developers, and stakeholders to create impactful learning solutions.\n\nCritical Thinking: Instructional design involves solving educational challenges creatively. Strong analytical skills are needed to assess learning needs and devise effective solutions.\n\nProject Management: You'll often manage multiple projects simultaneously. Organizational skills, attention to detail, and time management are vital to delivering projects on time and within budget.\n\nThe Role of Networking and Mentorship\n\nNetworking is another essential aspect of building a career in instructional design. Attending industry conferences, participating in webinars, and joining professional groups can provide valuable connections. A mentor can guide you through the initial stages of your career, helping you avoid common pitfalls and set you on a path to success. Learning from the experiences of others can shorten your learning curve significantly.\n\nThe Financial Aspect: Is Instructional Design Lucrative?\n\nOne often overlooked question is the financial aspect: Is being an instructional designer lucrative? Generally speaking, the field of instructional design offers competitive salaries. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for instructional designers was about $66,290 in 2020, with top earners making well over $100,000 annually. While these figures are subject to change based on experience, location, and the organization you work for, the financial rewards make the field appealing for many.\n\nCommon Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\nEmbarking on a new career path is fraught with challenges, and instructional design is no exception. However, knowing common pitfalls can help you navigate through them effectively.\n\nNot Updating Skills: The field of instructional design is ever-evolving. Not keeping up with new tools and methodologies can make your skills obsolete.\n\nIgnoring Feedback: As an instructional designer, you're not just creating content but facilitating learning. Ignoring feedback from learners and stakeholders can result in ineffective training materials.\n\nOverlooking Evaluation Metrics: It's essential to define the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) you'll use to measure the effectiveness of your courses. Neglecting this aspect can result in the failure of an otherwise well-designed course.\n\nA Roadmap for Transitioning Teachers\n\nFor teachers wondering how to transition, start by leveraging your knowledge of curriculum development and educational psychology. Create a roadmap to acquire the additional skills needed for instructional design. Follow blogs and podcasts on the subject to understand industry trends and challenges. Engage in online forums, consult peers who've transitioned, and start building your portfolio.\n\nWhere to Begin: Your First Steps into Instructional Design\n\nTaking the first step into a new career can be daunting, and instructional design is no exception. So, where should you begin? The answer is by identifying gaps in your existing skill set. Conduct a self-assessment to determine which skills you already have and what you need to develop. Create a list and set achievable milestones.\n\nFor those transitioning from teaching, the good news is you're not starting from scratch. You already have a fundamental understanding of educational principles. Your challenge is to broaden this understanding to fit a more diverse set of learners, which might include adult learners in a corporate setting.\n\nCreating Your First Portfolio\n\nSo, you've acquired some skills and want to showcase them? A portfolio is your best friend. Having a strong portfolio is often more important than having a degree. Read our detailed guide on Do you need a portfolio to get hired as an instructional designer for tips on what to include in your portfolio.\n\nThe Importance of Continuous Learning\n\nOnce you've stepped into the instructional design field, you'll find that the learning never stops. You must keep your skills up-to-date, whether it's new technologies, learning models, or methodologies. Subscribe to industry publications, attend conferences, and follow thought leaders on social media to ensure you stay ahead of the curve.\n\nSpecializations within Instructional Design\n\nAs the field of instructional design continues to grow, a plethora of specializations are emerging. For example, some designers specialize in healthcare education, others in corporate training programs, and some even specialize in designing educational video games. Your background and interests can dictate your niche within instructional design.\n\nFreelance or Full-time: Which is Right for You?\n\nAnother critical decision you'll need to make is whether you're looking for full-time employment or considering freelance opportunities. Both have their merits. Freelance instructional designers often enjoy greater flexibility but at the cost of job security and benefits. On the other hand, full-time positions offer stability but might come with a rigid work schedule. Our guide on How to get hired as an instructional designer with minimum experience can provide you with valuable insights into both options.\n\nJob Markets and Locations\n\nAlthough the internet has made remote work more feasible, location can still be a factor. Larger cities often offer more opportunities but can also come with higher living costs. Some areas have thriving educational technology sectors, while others may focus more on corporate training—research to find the market that fits your specialty and needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo wrap it up, becoming an instructional designer is neither a sprint nor a marathon—it's a lifelong journey. Becoming highly proficient takes more than 10 weeks or even years, but every day is an opportunity to grow and hone your skills.\n\nInstructional design is an evolving, challenging, and rewarding field.

Click below.\nCrafting Excellence in Instructional Design: Standing Out in a Crowded Market\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nCrafting Excellence in Instructional Design - How to Stand Out in a Crowded Market:\n\nIn the increasingly competitive field of instructional design, possessing the technical know-how is no longer enough. As a new instructional designer, you're entering a market teeming with talent. To survive and thrive, it's essential to stand out with experience in effectively designed projects and robust soft skills. In this post, I'll guide you through what it takes to distinguish yourself in this bustling industry.\n\nGaining Real Project Experience\n\nStart Small, Think Big\n\nBeginning your journey might seem daunting, especially when competing with experienced designers. Focus on accumulating a portfolio of real projects, even small-scale ones. This could mean volunteering for non-profits, contributing to open-source eLearning projects, or offering your services to small businesses. Remember, the goal is to build a body of work that demonstrates your skills.\n\nLeverage Every Opportunity\n\nNo matter how minor it may seem, each project is an opportunity to showcase your ability to handle various aspects of instructional design - from analyzing learning needs to creating engaging content and evaluating its effectiveness. Document your process meticulously and be ready to discuss your design choices, challenges, and outcomes.\n\nContinuous Learning\n\nStay abreast of the latest trends and tools in instructional design. Engage in professional development through webinars, workshops, and conferences. This enhances your skills and shows potential employers or clients that you're committed to staying at the forefront of your field.\n\nShowcasing Your Work\n\nBuilding a Compelling Portfolio\n\nYour portfolio is your professional narrative. It should tell the story of your journey as an instructional designer. Include diverse projects that showcase your range - from mobile learning to interactive eLearning modules and everything in between. Each project in your portfolio should reflect your understanding of instructional design principles and your ability to apply them effectively.\n\nArticulating Your Design Decisions\n\nAny designer can create a course, but a great designer can explain the rationale behind every course element. Be prepared to discuss why you chose a particular instructional strategy or tool, how you addressed specific learning challenges, and what the outcomes were.\n\nMastering Soft Skills\n\nNavigating Ambiguity\n\nProject requirements are often ambiguous in the real world, and constraints are a given. Develop the ability to navigate through uncertainty and make informed decisions. Adapting to changing circumstances and thinking on your feet is invaluable.\n\nEffective Communication\n\nAs an instructional designer, you'll interact with various stakeholders - from subject matter experts to learners. Effective communication involves:\n\nUnderstanding and adapting to different perspectives.\n\nManaging expectations.\n\nBeing clear and concise in your interactions.\n\nProblem-solving and Critical Thinking\n\nYou'll often encounter challenges that require creative solutions. This could be anything from budget constraints to technology limitations or diverse learner needs. A great instructional designer views these challenges as opportunities to innovate.\n\nCollaboration and Teamwork\n\nInstructional design is seldom a solo effort. You'll need to work effectively with teams, which could include other designers, developers, subject matter experts, and project managers. Being a team player and having the ability to collaborate seamlessly is crucial.\n\nStanding Out in a Crowded Market\n\nSpecialize\n\nConsider specializing in a niche area of instructional design. This could be anything from gamification to mobile learning or virtual reality. Specialization can make you more attractive to employers looking for specific skill sets.\n\nNetworking and Building Connections\n\nBuilding a professional network is crucial. Attend industry events, join online forums, and connect with other instructional designers. Networking can lead to collaborations, job opportunities, and valuable insights into the industry.\n\nThought Leadership\n\nContribute to the field of instructional design by sharing your knowledge and insights. Write blogs, create instructional design resources, or speak at industry events. This establishes you as a thought leader and adds to your credibility.\n\nSeeking Feedback and Being Open to Learning\n\nAlways seek feedback on your projects and be open to learning from it. Constructive criticism can be a powerful tool for growth.\n\nBuilding a Sustainable Career in Instructional Design\n\nBuilding a career in instructional design is akin to embarking on a marathon, not a sprint. It's about laying a brick-by-brick foundation to sustain you through a long and fulfilling career. Let's delve deeper into how you can build this foundation and make your mark in the instructional design community.\n\nDevelop a Learning Mindset\n\nThe instructional design landscape is dynamic, with new theories, tools, and technologies emerging regularly. Cultivating a learning mindset is crucial.

Diversifying your knowledge across these domains can enrich your instructional design practice, allowing you to create more holistic and compelling learning experiences.\n\nUnderstanding Business and Organizational Goals\n\nInstructional design doesn't exist in a vacuum. Often, it serves broader business or organizational goals. Understanding these goals and how your instructional design initiatives align with them is critical. This alignment ensures that your projects are relevant and demonstrates your strategic thinking to stakeholders.\n\nHarness the Power of Storytelling\n\nStories are a powerful tool in learning. They can make content more relatable and memorable. Developing storytelling skills can enhance your instructional design, making your courses more engaging and impactful.\n\nEmbrace Technology and Innovation\n\nFrom virtual reality to artificial intelligence, technology is reshaping how we learn. Stay abreast of these developments and explore how they can be integrated into your instructional design projects. However, always ensure that technology serves the learning objectives, not vice versa.\n\nThe Art of Feedback and Iteration\n\nFeedback is a goldmine for instructional designers. Learn how to solicit, interpret, and act on feedback. This iterative process of design, feedback, and improvement will significantly enhance the quality of your courses.\n\nBuilding a Professional Brand\n\nAs you grow in your career, consider how you want to be perceived in the industry. Building a professional brand isn't about self-promotion; it's about establishing a reputation as a reliable, innovative, and effective instructional designer. Your brand should reflect your unique approach, values, and professional ethos.\n\nNetworking and Mentorship\n\nNever underestimate the power of a solid professional network and mentorship. Connect with peers and experts in the field. A mentor can provide guidance, open doors, and offer insights based on their experiences. Similarly, mentoring others can also be a rewarding experience that sharpens your skills.\n\nBalancing Creativity and Practicality\n\nWhile creativity is a cornerstone of instructional design, it must be balanced with practicality. Solutions should be innovative but feasible, considering time, budget, and technology constraints. This balance is critical to successful project execution.\n\nConclusion: The Path to Becoming a Standout Instructional Designer\n\nTo stand out in the crowded field of instructional design, blend your technical prowess with soft skills, embrace continuous learning, and align your work with broader business objectives. Remember, every project you undertake is a stepping stone in your career path. Be open to exploring new avenues, take risks, and learn from every experience.\n\nAs you forge ahead in your journey, remember that being a great instructional designer isn't just about the courses you create; it's about the impact you make, the problems you solve, and the learners you inspire.

Click below.\nPedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, Peeragogy, Geragogy, and Cybergogy: 6 Theories that Shape 21st Century Learning\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nPedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, Peeragogy, Geragogy, and Cybergogy Learning Theories:\nIntroduction\n\nThe world of education and learning is constantly evolving, keeping pace with societal changes, technology, and the continually growing understanding of how humans learn. It's an exciting time to delve into pedagogy—a field far from static and full of potential to revolutionize how we teach and learn. Today's pedagogical landscape is enriched with a plethora of concepts that, until recently, were foreign to many. This dynamic field interacts with the vicissitudes of its surrounding context and continually adapts to emerging discoveries and progress in human knowledge.\n\nThis post aims to take you on a tour through six vital learning theories—Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, Peeragogy, Geragogy, and Cybergogy—that have gained prominence, particularly in the last few decades. Let's dive in.\n\nPedagogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nPedagogy focuses on teaching methods and practice, primarily catering to children.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nPedagogy encompasses instructional design, teaching methods, classroom management, and child development principles. It's teacher-centric, where the educator's role is to impart knowledge.\n\nPrinciples\n\nTeacher-led instruction\n\nStandardized assessment\n\nCurriculum-based education\n\nExamples\n\nClassroom lectures\n\nTextbook exercises\n\nHands-on activities under teacher supervision\n\nAndragogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nDeveloped by Malcolm Knowles, Andragogy targets adult learners and their specific learning needs and styles.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nAndragogy is less about accumulating information and more about learning through experiences and problem-solving.\n\nPrinciples\n\nSelf-directed learning\n\nLearning from experience\n\nProblem-centered learning\n\nInternal motivation\n\nExamples\n\nWorkshops\n\nCase studies\n\nCollaborative projects\n\nAndragogy has been around for more than a century but has gained renewed momentum recently, thanks to the works of scholars like Malcolm Knowles. It rests on five key assumptions:\n\nSelf-concept: Adult learners develop a self-directed approach as they mature.\n\nExperience: Accumulated experiences become a resource for learning.\n\nReadiness: Maturity brings readiness to learn relevant, role-related skills.\n\nOrientation: Adult learners are problem-centered rather than subject-focused.\n\nMotivation: For adults, the drive to learn is internal.\n\nHeutagogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nHeutagogy explores self-directed and self-determined learning. It extends andragogical practices to provide learners with skills to teach themselves.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nIn a heutagogical environment, the learner takes control of their learning journey, setting goals and deciding how to reach them.\n\nPrinciples\n\nLearner autonomy\n\nDouble-loop learning\n\nCapacity to know how to learn\n\nExamples\n\nOnline research\n\nInquiry-based projects\n\nSelf-assessment\n\nPeeragogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nPeeragogy emphasizes learning with and from peers. It's a co-learning model where participants learn by teaching each other.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nThis approach treats every participant as a teacher and a learner, focusing on creating a collaborative educational environment.\n\nPrinciples\n\nEquality among learners\n\nCollaborative learning\n\nShared knowledge creation\n\nExamples\n\nStudy groups\n\nOpen-source projects\n\nCommunity workshops\n\nGeragogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nGeragogy caters specifically to the learning needs of elderly adults, focusing on lifelong learning and enrichment.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nTeaching strategies in Geragogy are adapted to accommodate physical, psychological, and social changes associated with aging.\n\nPrinciples\n\nAge-appropriate pacing\n\nRelevance\n\nEmphasis on life skills and enrichment\n\nExamples\n\nSenior community courses\n\nOnline platforms for elderly learning\n\nMemory-enhancing games\n\nCybergogy\n\nWhat is it in simple terms?\n\nCybergogy combines elements of both pedagogy and andragogy to facilitate learning in a virtual or digital environment.\n\nWhat is it in teaching?\n\nCybergogy focuses on enabling autonomous and collaborative learning using technology, acknowledging that face-to-face and online strategies may differ.\n\nPrinciples\n\nLearner autonomy\n\nCollaborative learning\n\nDigital literacy\n\nExamples\n\nOnline courses\n\nVirtual simulations\n\nWebinars\n\nCybergogy is at the frontier of educational theories, aiming to effectively guide the use of new technologies in youth and adult education. At its core is an understanding that the strategies effective in traditional learning environments may need to be adapted or entirely rethought in digital landscapes.\n\nDeepening the Discussion\n\nWhile the basic outline and definitions provide a framework, let's delve deeper into these six educational theories' real-world applications and nuances. Understanding how they intersect with contemporary educational tools and technologies can give us fresh perspectives for 21st-century learning.\n\nThe Role of Technology\n\nTechnology has had a profound impact on how we approach teaching and learning. It has particularly emboldened theories like Cybergogy and Heutagogy. For instance, today's online platforms offer learners unprecedented control over their educational journey, embodying the principles of learner autonomy in Heutagogy. Similarly, the virtual environments in Cybergogy allow for a blend of pedagogical and andragogical strategies that make online learning more adaptive to individual needs.\n\nBridging Gaps\n\nOne of the key concerns in modern education is the issue of educational inequality. Pedagogical methods have often been critiqued for maintaining status quo inequalities. Andragogy and Heutagogy, with their focus on learner-centric education and self-directed learning, have the potential to bridge these gaps. They can empower learners to take charge of their educational paths, democratizing the learning process.\n\nLifelong Learning\n\nThe concept of lifelong learning is gaining traction and is notably prevalent in Geragogy and Andragogy. Geragogy doesn't merely focus on the educational needs of older adults; it also emphasizes the joy of continued learning throughout life. Andragogy, emphasizing problem-solving and applicability in real-world situations, sets the stage for continuous learning beyond formal education.\n\nThe Importance of Community\n\nPeeragogy and Cybergogy emphasize the community aspect of learning. The former relies on mutual teaching and peer learning, often enabled by online forums and social media. Cybergogy, using webinars, online courses, and virtual simulations, also allows for forming global communities of learners who can share resources and perspectives, enriching the learning experience for all.\n\nContextual Learning\n\nUnderstanding that learning doesn't happen in a vacuum is crucial. These theories can adapt to various cultural, social, and personal contexts. Heutagogy, for instance, is invaluable for those who need to adapt to rapidly changing industries, as it focuses on the capacity to know how to learn. On the other hand, Geragogy may incorporate cultural elements that are nostalgic or meaningful to older learners, making the learning process profoundly personal and, therefore, more effective.\n\nIn Practice: Case Studies and Applications\n\nPedagogy: Schools are increasingly incorporating project-based learning, which, although pedagogical in nature, allows for more student input than traditional methods.\n\nAndragogy: Corporate training programs often use experiential learning simulations to help employees understand and solve real-world problems.\n\nHeutagogy: Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) are usually designed with heutagogical principles, giving learners control over resources, objectives, and assessments.\n\nPeeragogy: Open-source software communities are excellent examples of peeragogy in action. Participants teach each other coding and problem-solving skills.\n\nGeragogy: Many retirement communities offer classes tailored to seniors' interests and capabilities, ranging from computer literacy to arts and crafts.\n\nCybergogy: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer courses on a wide variety of subjects, embodying the principles of learner autonomy, digital literacy, and community learning.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe six educational theories explored here—Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, Peeragogy, Geragogy, and Cybergogy—aren't just buzzwords. They are lenses through which we can examine the complex landscape of learning and teaching in the modern world. Understanding these can make us better learners and more effective teachers, mentors, and community members. They can inform organizational strategies for training and development, creating environments where everyone—from the youngest student to the most senior learner—can thrive.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nIn what ways have you personally experienced or applied the principles of Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, Peeragogy, Geragogy, or Cybergogy in your learning journey?

Click below.\nUnderstanding the Difference- Curriculum Developer and Instructional Designer:\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nDistinguishing Between Curriculum Developers and Instructional Designers:\n\nWhen discussing education, two roles often surface the curriculum developer and the instructional designer. These roles are crucial in developing and implementing educational strategies, yet they often get confused. As an instructional designer, I've been asked countless times about my work and its relation to curriculum development. This post aims to clarify these roles, delineating their distinctions, overlaps, and shared goal: improving learning experiences.\n\nDefining the Roles:\n\nFirst, let's define what these two roles entail:\n\nCurriculum Developer: This individual often works within K-12 or higher education institutions to design, implement, and evaluate curricular programs. A curriculum developer's primary focus is the 'what' of education—what subjects and skills should be taught to meet educational standards and learners' needs.\n\nInstructional Designer: While this role can also exist within K-12 and higher education, it's particularly prevalent in corporate training and e-learning sectors. Instructional designers primarily focus on the 'how' of learning—how content can be delivered most effectively to facilitate understanding, engagement, and retention.\n\nThe 'What' and 'How' of Learning:\n\nThe key difference between curriculum developers and instructional designers lies in their focus areas. The former are mainly concerned with curriculum content, while the latter are with how that content is delivered.\n\nCurriculum developers determine what learners need to know, mapping out a comprehensive plan that covers all required areas. They delve into learning standards, student data, and subject matter to craft a holistic curriculum that ensures students gain the necessary knowledge and skills. Moreover, curriculum developers keep a pulse on societal changes and technological advancements, adjusting the curriculum to prepare students for the future.\n\nOn the other hand, instructional designers focus on how this knowledge should be delivered to maximize understanding and retention. They apply learning theories and cognitive psychology to create instructional strategies that cater to diverse learning styles. They might convert dense academic content into interactive e-learning modules or transform an in-person training session into a compelling online course. Instructional designers work with multimedia tools and learning management systems, exploring innovative ways to make learning engaging and impactful.\n\nOverlaps and Collaborations:\n\nDespite their differences, these two roles intersect in significant ways. Both are responsible for improving education and enhancing learners' experiences. They share an understanding of how learning occurs and the factors that influence it, such as learner characteristics, environmental factors, and teaching strategies.\n\nFurthermore, collaboration between curriculum developers and instructional designers is essential for holistic learning design. While the curriculum developer identifies what should be taught, the instructional designer determines the best methods to teach that content. This interplay allows for the design of a comprehensive learning experience that covers the required content and engages learners effectively.\n\nThe Impact of Technology:\n\nWith the rise of online learning and technology use in education, the boundaries between curriculum developers and instructional designers have blurred even more. Both roles must now consider the integration of technology into teaching and learning processes.\n\nCurriculum developers are increasingly expected to incorporate digital literacy skills into the curriculum and ensure students are prepared for a tech-driven world. For their part, instructional designers are increasingly tasked with developing interactive online learning experiences that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.\n\nThe Value of Understanding:\n\nUnderstanding the difference between a curriculum developer and an instructional designer isn't merely pedantic. It's about appreciating the complexity of educational design and the many skilled professionals it takes to shape our learning environments. Both roles bring unique expertise to the table. By synergizing their skills, they create an educational experience that is both rich in content and delivered through a learning-centered approach.\n\nFuture Trends:\n\nAs we look ahead, the collaboration between curriculum developers and instructional designers will become more critical. With rapid technological advancements and the shifting dynamics of the digital age, both roles must evolve to meet the changing needs of learners.\n\nCurriculum developers will need to update and innovate curricula to stay relevant continually. As we integrate more technology into our lives, topics like digital citizenship, coding, data literacy, and AI will become standard curricula components at all levels.\n\nSimilarly, instructional designers will be challenged to keep online learning human-centered amidst a sea of emerging technologies. They'll need to explore areas like adaptive learning, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality and ensure these technologies enrich the learning experience rather than detract from it.\n\nEmbracing a Collaborative Future:\n\nIf there's one thing we can take away from this exploration, it's that successful learning design is a collaborative effort. It's not about choosing between 'what' to teach and 'how' to teach it, but rather understanding that these elements are two sides of the same coin.\n\nCurriculum developers and instructional designers each play their part in shaping the educational landscape. By working together, these professionals can create an engaging, relevant, and transformative learning experience that prepares learners for the future. In essence, they are the architects of learning—each contributing their unique designs to construct a robust and inspiring edifice of education.\n\nWrapping Up:\n\nSo, whether you're an educator seeking to understand your role better, a learner curious about the structure of your education, or a professional considering a career in educational design, I hope this deep dive into the roles of curriculum developers and instructional designers has been enlightening. Remember, education is not a solitary but a collective endeavor, and the harmonious collaboration of various roles leads us toward an enriched and enlightening learning experience.\n\nUltimately, our goal as educators, whether we're developing curriculum or designing instruction, is to create the best possible environment for learning. It's a challenging task, but with collaboration and a clear understanding of our roles, we can rise to the occasion.\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Today, we're diving into a topic that can often make or break your course design projects: working effectively with Subject Matter Experts, or SMEs for short. We've all been there, on either the blissful or dreaded end of the collaboration spectrum. When developing an impactful curriculum—whether for corporate training or educational institutions—your relationship with the SME can set the course for a smooth sail or a rocky voyage.\n\nWhy SMEs are Crucial in Instructional Design\n\nLet's face it. As instructional designers, we're savvy in the mechanics of effective learning, but we can't be experts in every domain for which we're creating courses. That's where SMEs come in. Their role is to bring subject-specific depth to the project. They possess comprehensive knowledge that helps an organization or educational institution perform at its best. Simply put, a partnership with the right SME can differentiate between a course that exudes elegant simplicity in imparting knowledge and one that becomes a chaotic tangle of complex, hard-to-digest information.\n\nThe Different Worlds of Instructional Designers and SMEs\n\nBefore diving into actionable tips, it's essential to acknowledge one thing: your perspective and SMEs will inherently differ. While you focus on user experience, pedagogy, and course effectiveness, your SME is an expert in a domain you're probably unfamiliar with. Understanding this difference is critical for effective collaboration.\n\nSix Proven Tips to Collaborate Successfully with SMEs\n\nTo bridge the gap, here are six strategies to strengthen your partnership with your SME, adapted and expanded from my personal experiences and collective wisdom in the industry:\n\n1. Active Listening\n\nYou might find SMEs passionate, even to the point of seeming difficult, especially in initial meetings. Why? They care deeply about the subject. Use active listening techniques to engage fully. Listen to the spoken and unspoken. Focus on their words and pay attention to what's unsaid, their emotional cues, and the weight behind their statements.\n\n2. Avoid Assumptions\n\nDon't fall victim to the \"false consensus effect,\" assuming the SME shares your views. Cognitive biases can easily lead to conflict. Always seek clarity by asking solid follow-up questions like, \"Could you elaborate on that point?\" or \"Why is this aspect crucial?\"\n\n3. Remove Communication Barriers\n\nOpen communication is a two-way street. Adapt your communication style to suit your SME. Are they detail-oriented or big-picture thinkers? Do you prefer emails over meetings? Adjust your communication methods to match their preferences and emotional state.\n\n4. Be Prepared to Disagree\n\nDisagreements aren't necessarily bad; they can result in richer course content if managed well. Learn the art of healthy conflict resolution. Understand why your SME feels strongly about certain content and be open to changing your perspective.\n\n5. Collaborative Compromise\n\nContrary to popular belief, compromise isn't a dirty word. It's the glue in a successful relationship between you and your SME. A compromise should lead to a technically accurate and pedagogically sound course.\n\n6. Set Expectations\n\nLay down the rules of engagement. Agree on how you'll communicate, meet deadlines, and review content. This can include using collaborative tools like Google Docs or project management software to streamline the workflow and minimize misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, you and your SME aim for the same end goal: maximizing performance through exceptional learning experiences. Effective collaboration with your SME is less about wrestling for control and more about harmonizing your unique strengths. So, the next time you find yourself in the SME labyrinth, let these six tips be your guiding thread.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Real-world Examples\n\nLet's get into some real-world scenarios to illustrate these principles further.\n\nThe Good: A Win-Win Scenario\n\nImagine working with an SME with vast experience and willingness to understand the course's learning objectives. By employing active listening and compromising where necessary, you find that your course is rich in content and easily digestible. The SME appreciates your ability to convert complex subjects into manageable learning units, and you appreciate their timely input and patience. This is the win-win scenario we all dream about.\n\nThe Bad: The Unresponsive SME\n\nWe've all experienced the SME who simply doesn't respond. They approve the project but are conspicuously absent during the design phase. Without their expertise, you find yourself stuck, making assumptions about the content that may or may not be accurate. In these instances, setting clear expectations and timelines from the outset can mitigate some of these issues. Moreover, try to find an alternative point of contact who can provide some expertise while continuously following up with the SME.\n\nThe Ugly: Conflict Zone\n\nThen, there's the scenario where disagreements are frequent and heated, making the project a breeding ground for tension and delayed deadlines. Both sides have valid points, but the inability to compromise leads to a stalled project. In such cases, returning to the course's core objectives can help realign both parties. No one wins if the project fails; thus, re-establishing a common goal can diffuse tension and get things back on track.\n\nUnderstanding SME Dynamics: Adapt Your Approach\n\nEvery SME is different. Some might be more technologically savvy and willing to work with the newest tools and platforms, while others might be more traditional, preferring face-to-face discussions and written feedback. Adapt your approach to suit the dynamics of your SME.

Click below.\nWhy Every Instructional Designer Should Know Visual Design Principles\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nThe Interplay of Instructional & Visual Design - Why Every Instructional Designer Should Know Visual Design Principles:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of instructional design, it's not enough to craft compelling content; how it is presented is equally crucial. This is where visual design principles come into play. For instructional designers (IDs), understanding these principles can elevate their creations from \"good\" to \"exceptional.\" But what exactly are these principles, and how do they mesh with the world of instructional design? Let's delve deeper.\n\nWhy Visual Design Principles Matter in Instructional Design\n\nWe're visual creatures. Research shows that around 65% of the population are visual learners, meaning they process information best when presented visually. With this in mind, it becomes clear why incorporating visual design principles into eLearning or any instructional module is indispensable.\n\nMoreover, a well-designed course engages the learner and boosts comprehension and retention. It provides clear visual cues, reduces cognitive load, and creates a memorable learning experience. In essence, good graphic design complements instructional objectives, propelling the effectiveness of the educational material.\n\nCore Visual Design Principles Every ID Should Know\n\nBalance: Like balancing elements in life, visual balance gives a design structure and stability. It involves the distribution of elements, ensuring that no side feels 'heavier' than the other. Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, but the aim remains—creating a harmonious, cohesive look.\n\nContrast: Using contrasting colors, sizes, or shapes can draw attention to key information. This principle helps important content stand out and guides the learner's eye through the instructional material.\n\nAlignment: Proper alignment provides a clean, organized design. Whether it's text, images, or multimedia elements, consistent alignment ensures clarity and avoids confusion.\n\nRepetition: Repeating certain design elements (like icons for key takeaways) throughout the course provides a sense of unity and consistency. It also aids in reinforcing certain concepts or branding elements.\n\nProximity: Elements related to the same topic or idea should be grouped together. This principle facilitates logical content flow and boosts comprehension.\n\nWhite Space: Also known as 'negative space,' this isn't just about the color white. It refers to the unmarked areas between design elements. Effective use of white space avoids clutter, increases readability, and emphasizes critical content.\n\nHierarchy: This is about showcasing the importance of information using design. Bigger fonts, bold colors, or strategic placement can easily highlight main ideas, guiding learners through content layers.\n\nIncorporating Visual Design into Your Instructional Modules\n\nStart with the Audience: As with any instructional design project, begin by understanding your learners. Consider their demographics, cultural backgrounds, and possible visual impairments. Such insights will guide your visual choices.\n\nMarry Content with Visuals: Visuals shouldn't be an afterthought. As you design the instructional flow, simultaneously think of the visuals that would best support the content. A complex concept might benefit from an infographic, while a flowchart might best explain a process.\n\nStay Consistent: Choose a color palette, font family, and a set of icons or imagery and stick to them throughout the course. Consistency reinforces branding and offers a cohesive learning experience.\n\nFeedback Through Design: Use visual cues to provide feedback. For instance, correct answers could glow green, or a progress bar could fill up as a learner advances, providing motivation and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nOptimize for Different Devices: With the rise of mobile learning, ensure your designs are responsive. What looks good on a desktop might not be on a mobile device. Optimize visuals to ensure clarity across all platforms.\n\nIterate and Test: As with all designs, it's crucial to test, gather feedback, and iterate. What seems visually appealing to you might not resonate with the learners. Regularly gather feedback and be prepared to make adjustments.\n\nThe Symbiosis of Visual Design & Learning Retention\n\nHaving explored the importance and integration of visual design principles in instructional content, it's worth delving into how these visuals directly impact learning retention and comprehension. At its core, instructional design is about facilitating learning, and visuals play an undeniable role in enhancing this process.\n\nHow Visual Design Enhances Memory Retention\n\nDual Coding Theory: Proposed by Allan Paivio in the late 1970s, this theory suggests that verbal and visual information are processed differently and have separate representations in memory. When learners encounter both verbal and visual stimuli (like text and an accompanying image), they have two ways to remember the information, increasing the likelihood of retention.\n\nReduced Cognitive Load: When represented visually, complex ideas can simplify the required information processing. For instance, a well-designed infographic can encapsulate pages of data into a single, comprehensible visual, making it easier for learners to grasp and remember.\n\nEmotionally Engaging: Humans are innately drawn to visuals. A poignant image or a captivating design can evoke emotions, making the learning experience more engaging and memorable. Emotion, as research suggests, is a potent catalyst for memory.\n\nLeveraging Visuals for Deeper Engagement\n\nStorytelling through Imagery: Humans have been storytellers for millennia. Incorporating visuals that tell a story—be it the journey of a concept or the evolution of a product—can draw learners in. This narrative approach not only makes content engaging but also aids in placing information in a relatable context.\n\nInteractive Visuals: Technological advancements have transformed static visuals into interactive elements. Consider using interactive graphs, clickable infographics, or drag-and-drop activities. These not only make the content visually appealing but also promote active learning.\n\nCultural Consideration in Visuals: Visual cues can vary significantly across cultures. What's considered a positive visual cue in one culture might be neutral or even negative in another. Awareness of and sensitivity to such nuances ensures that your visual design resonates universally.\n\nSimplify to Amplify: Using flashy graphics or intricate designs might be tempting, but simplicity often yields better comprehension. Use clean lines and harmonious color schemes, and avoid visual clutter. The goal is to amplify the content, not overshadow it.\n\nConclusion: An Ongoing Journey of Visual Exploration\n\nInstructional design's beauty lies in its evolving nature. As learners change, so do the methodologies and techniques to engage them. Visual design isn't just a supplementary skill for instructional designers; it's a powerful tool in the arsenal. By intertwining effective visuals with solid content, we can craft experiences that are memorable, engaging, and impactful.\n\nThe synergy of instructional and visual design sets the stage for holistic learning experiences. So, as we continue to design, let's keep our eyes open and our palettes vibrant, ensuring every instructional journey we craft is as visually delightful as it is educative. After all, in the theater of learning, visuals set the stage for unforgettable performances.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nHow can we effectively balance the use of advanced visual design elements with the core principles of instructional design to ensure that learners are not only engaged but also comprehending and retaining the essential content?

Click below.\nEvaluating Course Effectiveness: A Guide for New Instructional Designers\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nHow to Evaluate Your Course or Training Effectiveness:\n\nAs an instructional design trainer and hiring manager, I've observed that many new instructional designers excel at creating engaging course content but often struggle with one crucial aspect: effectively evaluating the impact of their courses. This comprehensive guide is aimed at helping you, as a new instructional designer, navigate through the process of assessing the effectiveness of your courses, with a particular focus on the widely respected Kirkpatrick Model.\n\nThe Imperative of Effective Evaluation:\nView fullsize\n\nIn the world of instructional design, crafting content is only a part of the success equation. The real measure of a course's worth lies in its ability to achieve intended outcomes - whether enhancing skills, changing behaviors, or contributing to organizational goals. Understanding and implementing effective evaluation strategies is crucial in determining whether these objectives are met.\n\nDemystifying the Kirkpatrick Model\n\nThe Kirkpatrick Model, established in 1954 by Donald Kirkpatrick, remains a gold standard in assessing training effectiveness. This model provides a comprehensive framework that works across various sectors, including government, military, corporate, and others. Its flexibility and universal applicability make it an invaluable tool for instructional designers.\n\nLevel 1: Reaction\n\nThis level assesses how participants react to the training. Immediate feedback, usually via surveys or feedback forms, helps gauge the training's engagement level and perceived relevance.\n\nLevel 2: Learning\n\nHere, the focus is on understanding whether participants have effectively learned from the training. This involves evaluating knowledge, skills, and attitude changes through tests and simulations.\n\nLevel 3: Behavior\n\nBehavioral change, a critical indicator of training effectiveness, is measured at this level. It examines the application of learned skills in real-world settings, often requiring follow-up assessments and managerial feedback.\n\nLevel 4: Results\n\nThe final level evaluates the tangible organizational impact of the training, such as improvements in productivity or quality. This involves a deeper analysis of performance metrics and ROI.\n\nApplying the Model in Reverse\n\nExperts suggest starting with the desired results (Level 4) and working backward. This reverse application aligns each training aspect with specific organizational goals, ensuring the training is strategically focused.\n\nAlternatives to the Kirkpatrick Model\n\nWhile the Kirkpatrick Model is effective, it's not the sole framework at your disposal. The Phillips ROI Model adds an ROI calculation to the Kirkpatrick Model, and Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method focuses on identifying the most and least successful cases to understand the impact.\n\nPhillips ROI Model:\n\nView fullsize\n\nThe Phillips ROI Model, developed by Dr. Jack Phillips, is an advanced approach to training evaluation, extending the Kirkpatrick Model by adding a fifth level focused on Return on Investment (ROI). \n\nThis model delves into the financial impact of training and development programs. After measuring the four levels of the Kirkpatrick Model - Reaction, Learning, Behavior, and Results - the Phillips ROI Model takes an extra step to convert the results into monetary values. It then compares these values to the program's overall cost, providing a clear picture of the financial return on investment. \n\nThis method is particularly useful for organizations looking to justify training expenditures in concrete financial terms. It assesses the true economic value of training programs by quantifying outcomes such as improved productivity, reduced costs, and enhanced quality of work, converting these improvements into financial gains that can be weighed against the costs of the training program.\n\nBrinkerhoff's Success Case Method\n\nDeveloped by Dr. Robert O. Brinkerhoff, Brinkerhoff's Success Case method is a unique approach to evaluating the impact and effectiveness of training programs. This method focuses on identifying the most and least successful cases within a training program and closely examining these extremes through in-depth interviews and qualitative analysis. The primary goal is to uncover detailed stories or scenarios that illustrate how different individuals have applied the training effectively or ineffectively. \n\nBy analyzing these success and non-success cases, the method provides valuable insights into how and why certain aspects of the training work or don't work. This approach not only highlights the most impactful elements of the training but also sheds light on potential improvements or adjustments needed for future iterations. \n\nUnlike traditional models that might rely heavily on quantitative data, Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method offers a more narrative-driven, qualitative understanding of a training program's real-world application and impact.\n\nHow to Evaluate Your Course or Training Effectiveness:\n\nImplementing Effective Evaluation: Effective evaluation is more than just an end-of-course activity; it should be integrated into the entire instructional design process:\n\nAlign with Organizational Goals: Your evaluation methods should be tailored to measure meaningful outcomes for stakeholders.\n\nUse Mixed Methods: Combine qualitative and quantitative approaches for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nPlan Early for Evaluation: Integrate evaluation planning from the beginning of your course design.\n\nEmphasize Behavioral Change: Focus on how effectively the training translates into practical, on-the-job application.\n\nCollect Long-term Data: Some training impacts materialize over time, so plan for longitudinal data collection.\n\nAddressing Common Evaluation Challenges:\n\nMeasuring Intangible Outcomes: When direct observation of training impact is challenging, use surrogate measures and qualitative evaluations.\n\nResource Constraints: For resource-intensive evaluations, prioritize critical programs and adopt streamlined methods for others.\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Involve stakeholders early in the evaluation process to ensure alignment and support.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Elevating Instructional Design Through Evaluation:\n\nIn conclusion, effectively evaluating your courses separates a good instructional designer/learning designer from a great one. By utilizing frameworks like the Kirkpatrick Model and embedding evaluation into your design process, you can ensure that your courses deliver real, tangible results. This enhances your credibility as an instructional designer and contributes significantly to the learning and development goals of your organization.\n\nRemember, in the crowded field of instructional design, your expertise in not just creating content but proving its effectiveness will set you apart. So, as you embark on this journey, embrace the challenge of evaluation — it’s your tool for continuous improvement and professional growth.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nWhat specific challenges have you faced in evaluating the effectiveness of your instructional design projects, and how did you address these challenges to ensure your designs not only meet but exceed learning objectives and stakeholder expectations?\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nMastering the Art of Collaborating with Subject Matter Experts in Instructional Design\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nBeyond Button-Pushing in Articulate Storyline: \n\nInteractivity in instructional design is often relegated to mere button-pushing—click next to proceed, select an answer, drag and drop. However, the real power of interactivity lies in its potential to create \"aha\" moments, those magical instances where the learner makes a meaningful connection or gains a new insight that enhances their understanding of the subject matter.\n\nWhat is Intentional Interactivity?\n\nIntentional interactivity means every interactive element is designed with a specific learning objective. Instead of using interactivity as a filler or as a break from \"boring\" instructional content, intentional interactivity aims to challenge the learner's understanding, provoke critical thinking, and lead them to meet the learning objective. Intentional interactivity serves as a tool for accountability, ensuring that the learner engages in cognitive labor, thus resulting in true understanding and long-term retention.\n\nThe Connection Between \"Aha\" Moments and Learning Objectives\n\nEvery well-designed course or training module starts with clear learning objectives. These objectives spell out what the learner should be able to do or understand after completing the course. The \"aha\" moment is when the learner internalizes these objectives, achieving a depth of understanding that transcends rote memorization or surface learning. When interactivity is aligned with learning objectives, it catalyzes these \"aha\" moments, making them not just possible but likely.\n\nAdult Learning and Levels of Interactivity\n\nWhen we delve into the realm of eLearning and instructional design, we encounter varying levels of interactivity. These levels range from passive learning or \"page-turners\" to enriched interactions that offer a rich, immersive experience. Each level serves a different purpose and is suitable for additional training or learning outcomes.\n\nPassive Learning (Page-Turners): At this level, the learner merely receives information and has little to no control over the learning journey. It is apt for policy training, where the aim is to disseminate information.\n\nLimited Interactions: Here, the learner has more control and engages in simple interactions and exercises. This level is commonly used for on-the-job performance or skill development courses.\n\nModerate Interactions: These involve complex designs like branching scenarios and simulated environments. The learner is actively involved in the learning process, and this level is suitable for training that requires problem-solving or cognitive skills.\n\nEnriched Interactions: The highest level of interactivity, enriched interactions are designed for courses where learners must apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. These interactions are often rich multimedia experiences that give learners complete control over their learning process.\n\nUnderstanding these levels of interactivity allows instructional designers to make informed decisions about which type to use to trigger those \"aha\" moments.\n\nCrafting Intentional Interactivity\n\nHere are some tips on how to incorporate intentional interactivity in your instructional design:\n\nAlignment with Learning Objectives: Every interactive element must be aligned with one or more learning objectives. The alignment ensures that the interactivity serves a pedagogical purpose.\n\nReal-world Scenarios: Use scenarios that mimic real-life situations the learner is likely to face. This creates relevancy and makes the learner more likely to engage with the material deeply.\n\nInstant Feedback: Offer immediate feedback on the choices the learner makes. Feedback is crucial for reinforcing correct behavior or for identifying areas for improvement.\n\nAdaptive Learning Paths: Consider using adaptive learning paths that respond to the learner's actions and choices, offering a customized learning experience.\n\nCheck for Understanding: Interactivity should include moments where learners must apply what they've learned, thus serving as a tool for accountability.\n\nInvolve the Learner: Activities like simulations, role-playing, and decision-making exercises empower the learner to take charge of their learning, providing them the space to make mistakes and learn from them.\n\nThe Aha Moments and Accountability\n\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of intentional interactivity is its role in fostering accountability. In a well-designed eLearning course, every interaction isn't just a hurdle to clear; it's a mini-assessment, a way for learners to prove to themselves (and to the instructor or system) that they have grasped the intended lesson.\n\nThe accountability angle works on two fronts:\n\nSelf-Assessment: As learners engage with the interactive elements, they gauge their understanding of the material. This introspective process often leads to those \"aha\" moments when learners suddenly grasp a concept they struggle with.\n\nPerformance Metrics: Interactivity can also be a tool for instructors or organizations to track learner progress. Features like completion rates, interaction engagement metrics, or even more complex analytics can be valuable for ongoing course improvement and personalizing learning pathways.\n\nThe Role of Technology in Crafting Intentional Interactivity\n\nThe advance of technology has provided instructional designers with sophisticated tools to create different layers of interactivity. From tools like Articulate Storyline to Adobe Captivate, each has its own set of features that allow the integration of various multimedia elements, quizzes, and scenarios.\n\nHowever, these tools are just enablers; the effectiveness of your interactive design still hinges on the strategic planning and intentional implementation of these technologies to serve your learning objectives.\n\nHere are a few tech tips:\n\nMobile Responsiveness: Ensure that your interactive elements work seamlessly across devices, especially if your learners are likely to access the course on a mobile device.\n\nUser Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX): A good UI and UX design can significantly impact how the learner interacts with the course. Poor navigation or complicated interfaces can detract from the learning experience.\n\nAccessibility: Ensure your interactive elements are accessible to people with disabilities. This might include providing alt text for images or ensuring keyboard navigability.\n\nBalancing Interactivity and Cognitive Load\n\nWhile adding interactive elements can make a course more engaging, it's essential to consider the cognitive load—essentially, how much mental effort it takes to go through the course. Learners may become overwhelmed and miss the core message if a course is too \"busy\" with interactions.\n\nBalancing interactivity involves:\n\nChunking Information: Divide the course material into small, manageable chunks that are easy to digest and remember.\n\nProviding Optional Paths: For more experienced learners, offer the option to skip over information they already know.\n\nContextual Guidance: Use tooltips or other guiding elements sparingly to provide additional information without overwhelming the screen or the learner.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nInteractivity in instructional design has the potential to be transformative, but only if employed with intention and precision. Aim for those \"aha\" moments by aligning your interactive elements tightly with learning objectives, using technology wisely, balancing cognitive load, and remembering that accountability is a two-way street. Interactivity should not just be engaging; it should demand—and reward—engagement. When done right, interactivity will not just lead to better learner outcomes; it will make your course unforgettable. \n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nHow do you balance the level of interactivity in your courses to both engage learners and ensure they meet specific learning objectives without overwhelming them?

Click below.\nExperiential Learning Design Frameworks and Learning Theories for Instructional Designers\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nWhat are Experiential Learning Design Frameworks?\nIntroduction\n\nIn the dynamic field of instructional design, staying abreast of evolving methodologies is crucial. Among these, experiential learning is a powerful approach, offering immersive, practical experiences that significantly enhance learning outcomes. This blog post delves into various experiential learning design frameworks and learning theories, providing instructional designers with insights to enrich their practice.\n\nUnderstanding Experiential Learning\n\nExperiential learning is rooted in the concept that learning is most effective when learners are actively engaged in reflective and hands-on experiences. This approach contrasts with traditional didactic methods, emphasizing real-world application over theoretical knowledge.\n\nKey Principles:\n\nDirect Experience: Learners engage in activities that offer practical, real-world experiences.\n\nReflection: Critical reflection on these experiences is vital for learning.\n\nConceptualization: Learners abstract and conceptualize their experiences into broader understandings.\n\nApplication: Applying learned concepts in new situations reinforces and expands learning.\n\nKolb’s Experiential Learning Theory\n\nDeveloped by David Kolb in the 1980s, this theory is foundational in experiential learning. It proposes a four-stage learning cycle:\n\nConcrete Experience: Learners encounter new experiences or reinterpret existing experiences.\n\nReflective Observation: Learners reflect on the experience from multiple perspectives.\n\nAbstract Conceptualization: Learners integrate their reflections into new ideas or concepts.\n\nActive Experimentation: Learners apply their new understanding in the world, leading to new experiences.\n\nDewey’s Model of Experiential Learning\n\nJohn Dewey, an early 20th-century educator and philosopher, laid the groundwork for modern experiential learning theories. He emphasized the importance of experience in education and proposed a five-step model:\n\nA Genuine Situation of Experience: The experience must be real and meaningful.\n\nA Need to Know: The experience should create a natural curiosity.\n\nSupport in Inquiry: Learners should be guided in exploring and understanding the experience.\n\nReflection: Reflecting on the experience is key to internalizing learning.\n\nApplication: The final step involves applying the new knowledge or skills.\n\nThe 70:20:10 Framework:\n\nThis framework suggests that 70% of learning comes from job-related experiences, 20% from interactions with others, and 10% from formal educational events. It’s particularly relevant in corporate training and development.\n\nImplementation:\n\n70% - Experiential Learning: On-the-job tasks, challenges, and problem-solving.\n\n20% - Social Learning: Learning from others through coaching, mentoring, and collaborative learning.\n\n10% - Formal Learning: Structured courses and training.\n\nThe 5E Instructional Model\n\nThis model, often used in science education, consists of five phases:\n\nEngage: Stimulate interest and curiosity.\n\nExplore: Hands-on exploration and inquiry.\n\nExplain: Conceptual understanding through explanation.\n\nElaborate: Extend and apply learning.\n\nEvaluate: Assess understanding and skills.\n\nGagné’s Nine Events of Instruction\n\nWhile not exclusively experiential, Gagné’s framework can be adapted to experiential learning contexts. It includes:\n\nGain Attention\n\nInform Learners of Objectives\n\nStimulate Recall of Prior Learning\n\nPresent the Content\n\nProvide Learning Guidance\n\nElicit Performance\n\nProvide Feedback\n\nAssess Performance\n\nEnhance Retention and Transfer\n\nConstructivist Learning Theory\n\nConstructivism posits that learners construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. Key aspects include:\n\nLearner-Centered: Learners actively construct their knowledge.\n\nProblem-Based Learning: Real-world problems encourage exploration and learning.\n\nCollaboration: Learning is often enhanced in a social context.\n\nSituated Learning Theory\n\nSituated learning theory suggests that learning is inherently tied to the activity, context, and culture in which it occurs. This theory emphasizes:\n\nAuthentic Context: Learning occurs in situations mirroring real-life contexts.\n\nSocial Interaction: Learning is a collaborative, community-based process.\n\nReflection: Reflection on real-world experiences is crucial.\n\nThe ADDIE Model\n\nADDIE—Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation—is a widely used model in instructional design. Though not exclusively for experiential learning, it can structure experiential learning designs effectively.\n\nThe SAM Model\n\nThe Successive Approximation Model (SAM) is an agile development model. It’s iterative, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptability, making it suitable for designing experiential learning programs.\n\nBandura’s Social Learning Theory\n\nAlbert Bandura’s theory emphasizes learning through observation, imitation, and modeling. It's particularly relevant in the design of mentoring and coaching experiences.\n\nProblem-Based Learning (PBL)\n\nProblem-Based learning is a learner-centered approach where students learn about a subject through the experience of solving open-ended problems. In PBL, learners are presented with a problem and use self-directed learning strategies to solve it. This approach is highly effective in developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nKey Features:\n\nReal-World Problems: Problems are complex, ill-structured, and mirror real-world scenarios.\n\nSelf-Directed Learning: Learners take responsibility for their learning process.\n\nFacilitator's Role: Instructors act as facilitators or guides rather than traditional teachers.\n\nProject-Based Learning (PjBL)\n\nProject-Based learning involves students in a dynamic process of inquiry and problem-solving related to an engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge. Students often work in teams and create a project or presentation as the final product.\n\nImplementation:\n\nAuthentic Tasks: Projects are centered around authentic, real-world tasks and challenges.\n\nCritical Thinking: Encourages students to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\nCollaboration: Fosters collaborative skills as learners work in groups.\n\nService Learning\n\nService Learning combines learning objectives with community service. This approach enriches the learning experience, teaches civic responsibility, and strengthens communities.\n\nKey Aspects:\n\nCommunity Service: Students engage in activities that meet community needs.\n\nIntegrated Learning: Learning objectives are tied directly to the service activity.\n\nReflection: Students reflect on their experience, its impact, and the learned skills.\n\nTransformative Learning Theory\n\nDeveloped by Jack Mezirow, this theory focuses on the process of perspective transformation. It involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions.\n\nElements:\n\nCritical Reflection: Reflecting on assumptions and beliefs.\n\nRational Discourse: Engaging in discussions to validate new perspectives.\n\nExperience: Learning from experience is central to transforming perspectives.\n\nGame-Based Learning (GBL)\n\nGame-Based learning involves the use of games to enhance the learning experience. GBL can motivate learners, promote dynamic participation, and help develop problem-solving skills.\n\nFeatures:\n\nEngagement: Games are engaging and can make learning more enjoyable.\n\nFeedback: Immediate feedback helps learners understand their progress.\n\nAdaptability: Games can be adapted for various learning styles and objectives.\n\nTechnology-Enhanced Learning (TEL)\n\nWith the integration of technology in education, TEL offers diverse opportunities for experiential learning through virtual simulations, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAdvantages:\n\nAccessibility: Technology makes learning experiences more accessible.\n\nInteractivity: Interactive simulations provide immersive learning experiences.\n\nCustomization: Learning experiences can be tailored to individual needs.\n\nNarrative Learning\n\nNarrative learning involves using storytelling and narratives as a tool for learning. Stories can be powerful means to capture attention, convey complex concepts, and connect emotionally with learners.\n\nKey Principles:\n\nStorytelling: Utilizing narratives to frame learning concepts.\n\nEngagement: Stories engage learners emotionally and cognitively.\n\nContextualization: Providing context and relevance to the learning material.\n\nExperiential Learning in Online Environments\n\nWith the rise of e-learning, experiential learning has adapted to online environments. Techniques include interactive scenarios, simulations, and collaborative projects that can be facilitated through digital platforms.\n\nOnline Adaptations:\n\nVirtual Simulations: Online simulations replicate real-world scenarios.\n\nCollaborative Tools: Digital platforms facilitate group collaboration.\n\nInteractive Content: Interactive elements enhance engagement and learning.\n\nFlipped Classroom Model\n\nThe flipped classroom is a pedagogical model in which the traditional lecture and homework elements are reversed. Pre-classroom activities involve watching lectures, and classroom time is devoted to exercises or projects, promoting a more hands-on learning experience.\n\nImplementation:\n\nPre-Classroom Activities: Learners engage with lecture material at home.\n\nIn-Class Activities: Classroom time is used for interactive, experiential learning activities.\n\nFinal Reflections\n\nIncorporating experiential learning into educational design not only enhances the learning experience but also prepares learners to meet the challenges of an ever-changing world. As instructional designers, our role is to harness these varied frameworks to foster a deeper understanding, critical thinking, and practical application of knowledge. The future of education lies in our ability to adapt, innovate, and inspire through experiential learning methodologies.\n\nThis comprehensive exploration of experiential learning frameworks and theories underscores the dynamic nature of instructional design.

Click below.\nHow to complete a Learner Analysis: A Deep Dive into Understanding Your Audience\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nPrint the Article\n\nCompleting a Learner Analysis: \n\nIn the intricate dance of instructional design, understanding your audience is akin to learning the steps before you set foot on the stage. It's a foundational element, often overlooked yet crucial for the success of any educational endeavor. Learner analysis, a systematic approach to understanding the characteristics of the learner group, is a vital step in this process. This post explores the multifaceted nature of learner analysis and how it can be effectively implemented in instructional design.\n\nWhat is Learner Analysis?\n\nAt its core, learner analysis is a process of gathering and analyzing information about the learners for whom an instructional design project is intended. This analysis helps instructional designers create learning experiences tailored to their audience's specific needs, abilities, preferences, and backgrounds.\n\nWhy is Learner Analysis Important?\n\nImagine crafting a learning experience in the dark without knowing who your learners are, what they already understand, what they need to know, and how they prefer to learn. The result would likely be a misalignment between the instructional materials and the learners' needs. Learner analysis illuminates this darkness, ensuring the instruction resonates with the learners and effectively meets their educational needs.\n\nCritical Components of Learner Analysis:\n\n1. Demographic Analysis\n\nUnderstanding the essential demographic characteristics of the learner group is a starting point. This includes age, gender, cultural background, language proficiency, and other socio-economic factors.\n\nWhy it matters: Demographics can influence how learners perceive content, their learning preferences, and even their access to learning materials.\n\n2. Knowledge and Skill Level\n\nAssessing the learners' current knowledge and skills is crucial. This involves understanding their educational background, prior experience with the subject matter, and existing skill levels.\n\nApplication: This information helps pitch the content at the right level, avoid redundancy, and fill knowledge gaps.\n\n3. Learning Preferences and Styles\n\nEvery learner is unique, with preferred ways of receiving and processing information. Some might be visual learners, others auditory, and others prefer hands-on experiences.\n\nStrategy: Designers can use this information to create multi-modal learning experiences that cater to diverse learning styles.\n\n4. Motivation and Attitudes\n\nUnderstanding what motivates learners and their attitudes toward the subject matter can significantly impact engagement and learning outcomes.\n\nTechnique: Use motivational strategies like gamification or real-world problem-solving to hook learners with varying levels of interest or motivation.\n\n5. Environmental Analysis\n\nThe learning environment, whether it's a traditional classroom or an online platform, can affect the learning process. Factors like access to technology, learning platforms, and time constraints are crucial.\n\nConsideration: Tailor the instructional strategy to fit the learning environment. For instance, in resource-limited settings, simplicity and offline accessibility might be key.\n\nImplementing Learner Analysis: Practical Steps:\n\n1. Data Gathering\n\nStart by collecting data through surveys, interviews, focus groups, or observation. Online tools and learning analytics can provide valuable insights into learner behavior and preferences.\n\n2. Data Analysis\n\nAnalyze the gathered data to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. This step is critical in transforming raw data into actionable insights.\n\n3. Creating Learner Personas\n\nDevelop learner personas, which are fictional representations of your primary learner groups. Personas help in visualizing the learners and making informed decisions about content, format, and delivery methods.\n\n4. Ongoing Feedback\n\nLearner analysis is not a one-time activity. Continuous feedback mechanisms should be integrated to adjust and improve the learning experience based on learner responses and changing needs.\n\nChallenges in Learner Analysis:\n\nWhile learner analysis is undoubtedly beneficial, it comes with its challenges:\n\nDiverse Learner Populations: In groups with high diversity, creating a one-size-fits-all solution can be challenging.\n\nChanging Learner Needs: Learners' needs and contexts can evolve, requiring flexible and adaptive instructional design.\n\nResource Constraints: Gathering and analyzing learner data can be resource-intensive.\n\nOvercoming These Challenges:\n\nEmbrace Diversity: Use inclusive design principles to cater to many learners.\n\nStay Agile: Be prepared to modify your instructional strategies based on ongoing feedback.\n\nLeverage Technology: Use educational technology tools to gather and analyze data efficiently.\n\nUnderstanding the Learner in a Broader Context:\n\nBuilding on the foundational aspects of learner analysis, we must expand our understanding to encompass not just who the learners are but also how they interact with the content, the environment, and each other. This broader perspective enables a more holistic approach to instructional design.\n\n1. Technological Proficiency\n\nUnderstanding learners' technological skills is vital in today's digital learning landscape. This includes familiarity with online learning platforms, digital tools, and general comfort with technology.\n\nAdaptation Strategy: For technologically less savvy audiences, include introductory sessions on using learning platforms or design more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.\n\n2.

Understanding group dynamics, such as learner interaction patterns, can enhance collaborative learning experiences.\n\nCollaborative Approach: Foster group activities and discussions that encourage interaction, ensuring collaborative learning is effectively integrated into the instructional design.\n\n3. Accessibility and Inclusivity\n\nIt is crucial to ensure that learning materials are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. This involves considering various accessibility standards and inclusivity principles.\n\nInclusive Design: Use accessible design practices like adding video captions, ensuring screen reader compatibility, and providing alternative text for images.\n\nImplementing Learner Analysis: Advanced Techniques:\n\n1. Data-Driven Insights\n\nLeverage learning analytics to gain deeper insights into learner behavior, engagement levels, and performance. This can include data from quizzes, discussion forums, and course interactions.\n\nAnalytical Approach: Use analytics to identify patterns and trends that can inform modifications in the course design.\n\n2. Scenario-Based Assessments\n\nBeyond traditional assessments, consider how learners apply knowledge in real-world scenarios. This involves creating situational judgment tests or simulations.\n\nPractical Evaluation: Develop scenarios that mimic real-life challenges to assess how learners apply their knowledge practically.\n\nChallenges in a Comprehensive Learner Analysis:\n\nData Overload: The sheer volume of data available can be overwhelming. It's essential to focus on data most relevant to the learning objectives.\n\nDynamic Nature of Learning: As learners progress through a course, their needs and understanding evolve, necessitating a dynamic and adaptive approach to instructional design.\n\nCultural Sensitivity: In a global learning environment, being sensitive to cultural differences and ensuring that content is culturally appropriate is crucial.\n\nOvercoming These Challenges:\n\nFocused Data Analysis: Concentrate on key performance indicators that align closely with the learning objectives.\n\nAdaptive Learning Pathways: Design courses that can adapt to the changing needs and progress of the learners.\n\nCultural Competence: To ensure cultural appropriateness, Engage with cultural experts or include diverse perspectives in the course design process.\n\nConclusion: Crafting a Learner-Centric Design\n\nIn conclusion, learner analysis in instructional design is an ongoing, dynamic process that requires a deep and comprehensive understanding of the learners. By considering a wide range of factors - from demographic details to technological proficiency and from group dynamics to accessibility - instructional designers can craft learning experiences that are not just informative but transformative and inclusive.\n\nRemember, the goal of learner analysis is to create a learner-centric design that acknowledges, respects, and caters to each learner's unique characteristics and needs.

Click below.\nFour Easy Ways Teens Can Network for College and Job Opportunities\n \nDownload\n\nNavigating high school and college applications is scary. It seems like there is so much to do, with not much clear explanation. However, you don’t need to fear as there are many resources around you that can help you with this daunting process! Outside of the extensive resource that is the internet, here is a list of places and people you can go to for more information.\n\n#1: Your high school’s guidance counselor and student services\n\nGuidance counselors are at your school to help you not only graduate, but succeed afterwards. Many times, employers and businesses forward information about job or internship opportunities to school guidance counselors. Some schools’ student services even provide an online database or stack of brochures.\n\nWhile using their online services can help to quickly scan through the options, talking to your guidance counselor regularly is extremely beneficial. For most colleges, your guidance counselor must write you a recommendation letter. Updating your counselor about what your current and future plans are helps them write a better letter with more details and substance. It allows them to see you more as a real person rather than just a student on paper.  Additionally, if counselors know about your interests, they would likely think to pass interest-specific job and internship opportunities to you first.\n\n\n#2: Teachers\n\nYour teacher is a great resource to help you get involved within and outside your school! All teachers have experienced and seen other students go through the college application process before. Consider asking your English teacher to review your college essay, they are a great resource for that.\n\nTeachers also are more involved with your school’s extracurriculars, as they are club advisors and interact with students more. If you need help navigating what clubs or programs to look into, asking your teacher would be an incredibly helpful way to get personalized recommendations.\n\n\nTeachers are also a common source of recommendation letters, as they interact with you almost every day. Keeping in touch with your teachers, via participating in class, talking to them after, or joining their club, helps them see you grow as a student and person. This is a crucial component in recommendation letters that stand out to admissions officers. Even when a new academic year starts and you get new classes, you should still interact with a few teachers over the course of multiple years to ensure a good relationship\n\n#3: Libraries\n\nLibraries often go underappreciated, however they are bursting with information. Along the library shelves may be test prep books and self-help books that could be of great use. Additionally, sometimes libraries host workshops and informational events for college admissions and job applications. Go to your local library or its website to find out if there are any events coming soon.\n\n\nYou can also reach out to your local librarians about any opportunities they may know of, like writing competitions or volunteer events. They could also possibly read over your college and job application essays!\n\n\n#4: Clubs\n\nParticipating in clubs is critical for your development in leadership skills and becoming a well-rounded applicant. It is also an excellent way to network and gain advice on college and job applications. \n\nClubs are usually interest and career-specific, which means its members hold similar interests to you, but also from different backgrounds and ages. This makes speaking to upperclassmen about their experiences much easier. \n\nAsking them about what job opportunities they participated in or have heard of is a great way to get involved. When they graduate, keep in touch with them so they can tell you about their post-high school experiences. They may invite you to their own personalized college school tour, or give more insight into what college is really like and whether it’s beneficial for your mutual interests.\n\nThese four resources are great ways to start off your high school year strong. A key part in using your resources wisely is maintaining meaningful relationships with school faculty and people in your community.\n\nAnother great resource is 24/7 Teach’s college application and leadership programs. Make yourself stand out as an applicant anywhere with their expert consulting!\n\nIf you are ready to start thinking about the college application process, set up a free strategy call with one of our 24/7 College Admissions specialists and learn everything you need to create a successful college application plan for yourself or your teen.\n\n\nHave questions about the College Admissions Process?\nSTART EARLY > SCHEDULE A FREE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS STRATEGY CALL →\nBefore You Go…\nWhy 24/7 Teach?

Click below.\nBridging Gaps and Driving Action: The Power of Action Mapping and Needs Analysis in eLearning Design\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nPrint the Article\n\nBridging Gaps and Driving Action:\n\nIn instructional design, particularly within the eLearning context, two methodologies effectively create impactful, results-driven training programs: action mapping and needs analysis. Pioneered by Cathy Moore, action mapping is a focused, practical approach designed to turn traditional, often ineffective training on its head. Combined with the foundational needs analysis process, these strategies offer a robust framework for instructional designers aiming to deliver more than just content—to deliver change.\n\nUnpacking Action Mapping:\n\nAt its core, action mapping is a visual approach to designing training programs that start not with content but with action. This method is predicated on the idea that eLearning should be a catalyst for change, driving learners not just to know more but to do more. It’s about aligning training with tangible business goals and designing learning experiences that engage learners in real-world application rather than passive consumption.\n\nThe Four-Step Framework:\n\nDefine the Business Goal(s): The starting point is a clear, measurable business goal that addresses a specific performance gap or organizational need. This goal should anchor all subsequent steps, ensuring that the training developed is directly relevant to improving business outcomes.\n\nIdentify the Actions: Once the goal is set, the focus shifts to identifying the specific actions or behaviors learners need to perform to achieve this goal. This step is crucial—pinpointing what learners need to do differently rather than what they need to know.\n\nDesign Practice Activities: With the desired actions in mind, the next step involves creating practice activities that simulate real-life scenarios. These activities should challenge learners to apply what they’re learning in practical, tangible ways, reinforcing the connection between the training and its real-world applications.\n\nIdentify the Minimally Necessary Information: Action mapping involves distilling the content to the most critical, need-to-know information supporting the identified actions. This step ensures that the training is streamlined, focused, and devoid of unnecessary content that can distract from the primary learning goals.\n\nThe Role of Needs Analysis:\n\nWhile action mapping provides a structure for designing impactful training, needs analysis is the investigative process that informs its direction. Needs analysis is all about digging deep to understand the root cause of performance gaps, the context in which learners operate, and the specific barriers they face in achieving desired outcomes. It’s a comprehensive exploration that seeks to answer three fundamental questions:\n\nWhat are learners currently doing?\n\nWhat do you want them to be doing?\n\nWhy is there a gap?\n\nThis process is essential for ensuring that the action mapping approach is grounded in reality, based on a clear understanding of learners' needs, and targeted towards making a measurable difference in performance.\n\nConducting a Needs Analysis:\n\nA thorough needs analysis typically involves several key activities:\n\nEngaging Stakeholders and Subject Matter Experts: Collaboration with those with a vested interest in the training’s outcomes is crucial for gaining a holistic view of the learning needs.\n\nGathering Data Through Various Methods: Surveys, interviews, focus groups, and observations can all yield valuable insights into the current state of learner performance and the factors contributing to any gaps.\n\nAnalyzing the Data: This involves looking for trends, identifying discrepancies between current and desired performance, and pinpointing the specific knowledge or skill gaps that must be addressed.\n\nIntegrating Action Mapping and Needs Analysis:\n\nIntegrating action mapping and needs analysis offers a strategic, dynamic approach to instructional design that focuses on real-world impact. Here’s how these methodologies complement each other in the design process:\n\nFoundation in Reality: Needs analysis ensures that the business goals and actions identified through action mapping are based on actual needs and performance gaps rather than assumptions.\n\nFocused Content: The insights gained from needs analysis help determine the minimally necessary information, ensuring the content developed is highly relevant and targeted.\n\nEngaging and Relevant Learning Experiences: The practice activities designed through action mapping are informed by a deep understanding of learners' real-world contexts, making them more engaging and effective.\n\nBest Practices for Implementing Action Mapping and Needs Analysis:\n\nTo leverage the full power of these methodologies, consider the following best practices:\n\nStart With the End in Mind: Keep the business goal at the forefront throughout the design process, ensuring that every element of the training is aligned with achieving this goal.\n\nEngage Learners in Active Practice: Design activities that mimic real-life challenges, encouraging learners to apply their skills and knowledge in practical contexts.\n\nIterate Based on Feedback: Use feedback from learners and stakeholders to continuously refine and improve the training program, ensuring it remains relevant and practical.\n\nSimplify: Resist the temptation to include extraneous content. Focus on what’s truly necessary for learners to perform the desired actions.\n\nA Path to Meaningful Impact:\n\nBy integrating action mapping with a thorough needs analysis, instructional designers can create eLearning experiences beyond mere knowledge transfer. This approach ensures that training programs are directly tied to business goals, focused on actionable learning, and designed with the learner’s real-world context in mind. It’s a pathway to better eLearning and training that drives real, measurable change.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced business environment, where the ability to adapt and perform is paramount, combining action mapping and needs analysis offers a powerful toolkit for instructional designers committed to creating meaningful, impactful learning experiences. Through this integrated approach, eLearning can become a pivotal force for organizational success, empowering learners to translate knowledge into action and achieve significant business results.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nReflecting on the principles of action mapping and needs analysis as presented, consider the current eLearning project you are working on or planning. Discuss how integrating these methodologies can enhance the effectiveness and impact of your project. Specifically, address the following points:\n\nBusiness Goal Alignment: Describe a specific business goal your project aims to support. How can you ensure that the training is directly relevant to improving business outcomes using action mapping?\n\nIdentification of Actions: Reflect on the specific actions or behaviors your learners need to perform to achieve the business goal. How does focusing on these actions, rather than just knowledge acquisition, change how you design your eLearning project?\n\nDesign of Practice Activities: Based on the actions identified, what types of practice activities could you or have you design to simulate real-life scenarios? How can these activities reinforce the connection between the training and its real-world applications?\n\nMinimally Necessary Information: Consider the concept of distilling content to only what supports the identified actions. How can you apply this to streamline your project, ensuring it is focused and free from unnecessary content?\n\nIntegration with Needs Analysis: Reflect on how a thorough needs analysis can inform the direction of your action mapping.

Click below.\n\nKeeping it Together: Managing the Stress of College Applications\n \nDownload\n\nThe college application process is an incredibly stressful time for high school students and their families. From figuring out which schools to apply to, to meeting the various requirements and deadlines, the process can most definitely feel overwhelming and exhausting. On top of that, there is also the weighing notion that this is something that is going to affect your future forever. It’s stressful, there’s no way to deny that fact. There is just so much going on, and coping with it all might seem difficult, but I can assure you it’s entirely possible.\n\nThe Perfect College For You\n\nOne of the biggest sources of stress for students is the fear of not getting into their dream school. For many students, the college they’ll attend will play a significant role in shaping their future careers and opportunities, and the thought of not being accepted can be devastating. This can lead to a lot of anxiety and pressure to perform well on tests, maintain a high GPA, and participate in extracurricular activities. \nFor other students, the realization that maybe they don’t have the grades or the scores to get into their dream school can be absolutely crushing. That’s where it’s important to understand that there isn’t just one school for you. There are so many universities out there. In fact, \nthere are almost 4,000 alone in the United States. College counselors will encourage you to apply to a few different universities, particularly using a strategy where you apply to a few safety schools, some target schools, and a few reach schools. Safety schools are the schools you like (or maybe love) but are a little easier to get into. With that sort of application strategy, you’re guaranteed to get in somewhere, and even if it isn’t your dream school, you might arrive there and realize it’s the perfect college for you. \n\nPicking a university isn’t necessarily about prestige. It’s about finding the university where you fit the best, so don’t get too stressed about getting into one specific school when there are 3,999 more out there who might want you.\n\nCollege Tuitions\n\nAnother source of stress is the cost of tuition. The rising cost of higher education can be a major concern for students and their families, particularly for those who may not have the financial means to pay for it. This can lead to students feeling pressure to apply to schools that may not be their first choice but are more affordable. \n\nThis is a real concern, especially today, where private universities can cost  80,000 dollars or more a year. It’s stressful having to always check the tuition prices, the financial aid packages, and the opportunities for scholarships, but don’t let the cost deter you from applying. Fancy private schools with the highest tuition also tend to have the most money on reserve. If you’re an appealing candidate, there is a good chance you’ll be awarded financial aid or at least merit aid. \n\nMoney is something that is always going to cause some stress, and there’s no way to really avoid that, especially considering the cost of universities, but there are always options, so don’t let money be your deciding factor.\n\nThe Application Process\n\nThe application process itself can also be stressful, as students must complete a number of different forms and provide transcripts, test scores, essays, and other materials. These requirements can be time-consuming and difficult to complete, particularly for students who are already juggling a full course load and other commitments. One way to alleviate some of this stress is to start the process early and stay organized. \n\nThis will help you avoid last-minute panic and ensure that they have enough time to complete all of the necessary requirements. It can also be helpful to seek guidance from school counselors, teachers, and other trusted adults who can provide advice and support throughout the process. \n\nAlso, remember, if you need anything from an external party (i.e., recommendation letters and transcripts) it’s always best to ask as early as possible, so you aren’t relying on others to make your deadlines. \n\nIt's also important for students to take care of themselves during this process. This means getting enough sleep, eating well, and finding time to relax and de-stress. Exercise and other activities that promote mental and physical well-being can also be helpful in reducing stress. Even though college applications will be taking up a lot of your time, always set aside time just for yourself to destress. It’s imperative to ensure the quality of your work and make sure you don’t get too overwhelmed during the process. \n\nSuccess is Subjective\n\nFinally, it’s important to remember that the college application process is just one part of a student’s life, and it’s not the end-all-be-all. Not every student gets into their top choice college, and that’s okay. There are many paths to success, and the college a student attends doesn’t define their future. It’s important to keep things in perspective and not put too much pressure on yourself.\n\nIn conclusion, the college application process can be a stressful time for students and their families. However, students can navigate the process with less stress and anxiety by starting early, staying organized, being realistic about expectations, taking care of oneself, and keeping things in perspective. Remember to keep calm and do your best, no matter what happens with your college application process, going to college is already a big achievement, no matter where you end up.\n\n24/7 Teach offers courses to prepare you to ace your college applications.

Click below.\n\nSAT vs ACT: What's the Difference and Why They're Important\n \nDownload\n\nSAT or ACT? These are two standardized exams that have been a crucial part in applications when students are applying to schools. Although not all schools require you to report your test scores in your application, it’s important to understand what the two tests are and which you should consider taking. Test scores help to strengthen your application in showing your scholarship past your transcript at your local school. These scores can also be used for merit-based scholarship applications. In this post we will compare the two tests to help you figure out which test is right for you.\n\nHow the Tests are Formatted\n\nA key difference between the two tests is that the ACT is structured into five subjects: English, Math, Reading, Science Reasoning, and an optional Essay section. Whereas the SAT only has three: Reading, Writing & Language, and Math. \n\nThe SAT’s reading section includes five passages, meanwhile the ACT has four. The SAT does not have a science section, however its reading section does include works of literature from the natural science field. While the ACT does have a science section, it does not test prior knowledge of science, instead it tests your critical thinking skills within natural science contexts.\n\nBoth tests’ math sections cover topics of arithmetic, Algebra I and II, Geometry, Trigonometry and Data Analysis. The SAT has a calculator inactive section, which mainly tests arithmetic skills. The ACT’s math section is completely calculator active.\n\nThe ACT Essay portion is 45 minutes long and tests your writing ability. It includes a prompt and describes three different perspectives of the prompt that you may align your response to. You are expected to write a well structured essay exemplifying your skills in reasoning and analysis to support the perspective. Click here to read through some ACT writing sample essays, this will best orient you to the structure of the test.\n\nLength and Scoring\n\nBoth tests are around 3 hours long. If taking the optional Essay option with the ACT, it is 3 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nThere is no penalty for guessing on either test. Each score is taken from the number of correct answers, then converted into “scale scores,” or each test company’s respective grading scales.\n\nSAT is scored on a range from 400-1600. Reading and Writing & Language are compiled to accumulate the highest of 800 points, and Math is worth a total of 800 points. Receiving a 1600 on the SAT represents perfect scores in both sections. The ACT follows a different grading scale, 1-36. Each section of the test is given a score from 1-36. The composite ACT score (which you use to report to schools and scholarships) is an average of those scores, rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo Which Should You Take?\n\nThe best way to know which test format is best for you is by taking a practice exam of each. Practice exams are the best way to prepare for either test, as the more comfortable you are with each test the better you will do. \n\nYou can quickly decide which is better for you based on which test you are more comfortable with understanding the test questions. A critical difference between the two tests is that the ACT includes a scientific reasoning section that the SAT doesn’t. If you are more comfortable with test taking in science, this test might be more in your comfort zone. Contrastingly, the SAT has more reading sections. If you are more comfortable with reading long works of text and comprehension questions, you might lean towards this test.\n\n\n\nRegardless, either test score is accepted by the majority of schools in the United States. Which test you choose does not change how admissions officers view your application. Choosing a test is more a personal matter of which test better suits your test-taking skills.\n\n\nWhy Do These Tests Matter?\n\nSince the pandemic, many schools have transitioned to a test-optional application process. Standardized tests are not the sole admittance factor in applications, as they are not completely definitive of a students’ intelligence.\n\nHowever, standardized tests are favored by schools as they help admissions offices compare students from different cities and states. The world is composed of many different high schools, that all may calculate grades in different ways. Having a standardized score allows students from different areas to have a more even playing field in score comparison.\n\nSchools also use applicant and admitted students’ test scores for data reports. Students interested in applying for schools can use these data reports to decide whether they are similar in demographic.\n\nAdditionally, scores can be used to qualify for merit-based scholarships from the CollegeBoard, ACT, and other organizations.\n\nAll of this goes to say that while tests are optional, it does not hurt to take them. Standardized scores allow admissions offices to directly compare between students from different regions. They also open more opportunities for students to find merit-based scholarships. Deciding on which test to choose is ultimately based on which format you are more comfortable with. Practice is key!\n\nPractice and gaining comfortability with test formatting is key in acing the SAT or ACT.

Click below.\n7 Concise Steps to Decide Which College to Commit To\n \nDownload\n\nOn the first day of every May is the long awaited College Commitment Day. Traditionally, students commit to the university of their choosing by May 1st (some schools have different deadlines for enrollment decisions.) \n\nChoosing the right university to enroll in can be a daunting task. It is a decision that will shape your future, both personally and professionally. There are a plethora of factors to consider when making this decision, and it can be overwhelming to know where to start. In this comprehensive guide, we will help you navigate the steps to take when choosing which school to commit to.\n\n\n#1: Determine Your Aspirations\n\nThe first step in choosing a school is to determine your goals. What do you want to achieve by attending university? Do you want to gain knowledge and skills in a particular field? Are you interested in pursuing a specific career? Understanding your goals will help you narrow down your options and choose a university that aligns with your aspirations. The following steps will guide you through different goals and how to research them specific to each school.\n\n#2: Consider Where the School is Located\n\nLocation is an important factor to consider when choosing where you will live and study. Do you prefer to stay close to home or are you open to studying abroad? Do you want to study in a rural or urban area? The location you choose will impact your overall university experience, so it's essential to consider your preferences and lifestyle when making your decision. You can research the location's climate and find online videos or articles about a regular day of someone that lives there.\n\n#3: Look Into Research Programs\n\nThe programs offered by a university can make a big difference in your decision. Look for universities that offer programs in your field of interest and consider the quality of the program. Look at the courses offered, the faculty, and the research opportunities available. Be very intentional in researching which program aligns with your career goals. But also keep in mind that your career goals could possibly change over the course of your undergraduate career. Looking into more exploratory studies and diversity in programs can also be a determining factor in what school is best for your goals.\n\n\n\n#4: Check the School’s Reputation\n\nIf the reputation of a university is important to you, look for universities with a good reputation in your field of study. Check the rankings of universities in your country and internationally. Speak to alumni and current students to get a sense of the university's reputation and academic life. Keep in mind school prestige is highly subjective, and choosing a school based solely from reputation may not always be the best school for your personal goals.\n\n\n\n#5: Consider Cost\n\nThe cost of attending university is a significant factor to consider. Look at the tuition fees, accommodation costs, and other expenses associated with attending the university. Consider your financial situation and weigh the costs against the potential benefits of attending the university. If a particular university is too far out of your budget, consider the more affordable option and look into surrounding career opportunities. If you have scholarship packages or opportunities to apply to scholarships, also take this into consideration in the offsetting of costs. You can also talk to financial advisors to better plan out the affordability of college.\n\n\n\n\n\n#6: Visit the Campus\n\nVisiting the campus is an excellent way to get a sense of the university's culture and atmosphere. Attend open days or schedule a campus tour to get a feel for the facilities, the faculty, and the student community. Speak to current students and professors to get a better sense of the university's culture and academic rigor.\n\n\n\n\n\n#7: Trust Your Gut\n\nUltimately, choosing a university is a personal decision, and you should trust your instincts. Consider all the factors we have outlined, but ultimately, choose a university that feels right for you. Whether this means taking a leap of faith and moving across the country, or knowing that staying close to home is the best decision. You are in charge of your own future!\n\n\n\n\nTo close, choosing a university is a challenging task, but with the right guidance, it can be a fulfilling and rewarding experience. Consider your goals, location, programs, reputation, cost, and visit the campus to make an informed decision. Remember, trust your gut and choose a university that feels right for you.

Click below.\nThree Things to Consider When Applying to University Abroad\n \nDownload\n\nHave you thought about applying to a university outside of the US? Well, there are a few important factors to consider when applying to a university that is outside of the U.S.\n\nThe Application\n\nNumber one, think about what type of application the college your applying to uses. While there are a number of international schools on the CommonApp, the majority of international universities will have a separate application from the U.S. ones.\n\nSchools in the UK use an application called the UCAS, or the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. It’s a single application that you sign up for just as you would sign up for the CommonApp, where you choose five universities in the UK to apply to. The UCAS will function as the application for all five schools, and there are no supplemental essays or separate questions to fill out per university. That being said, your personal statement for the UCAS cannot be the same as your personal statement for the  CommonApp. The UCAS website has a guide for writing your UCAS personal statement once you reach that section of the application, which helps you understand what the UCAS essay is being used to communicate. Certain universities in the UK are on the CommonApp, but if you are looking to apply to any of the big ones like Oxford or Cambridge, you need to use the UCAS. If you are applying to Cambridge or Oxford, you must complete a second application after the UCAS, which is the Cambridge or Oxford-specific application. Also, be prepared for any of the more prestigious colleges in the UK to ask you to participate in an interview before making an admission decision.\n\nSchools in Spain use an application called the SNUDE, or the Spanish National University for Distance Education. To apply in Spain as a non-EU student, you must do a few extra steps to apply. You will need recognition from your high school to show that you have attained the necessary certification to fulfill the education requirements in Spain. This recognition can be obtained at the Spanish Embassy. The Embassy then will provide you with a Volante Accreditation which can be used to apply to your university of choice in Spain. You will also have to register for a Spanish University entrance exam, also known as the selectividad or the Pruebas de Acceso a la Universidad. You may then apply to the university.\n\n\nSchools in France require a few pre-requesites for international students as well. First, you must pass the compulsory Preliminary Admission or as it’s called in France, the DAP(demande d’admission préable). You can apply for the DAP at the Culture and Cooperation Service of the French embassy in your country. Once you pass the DAP you can apply to whatever French university you want on the Etudes en France platform. Certain degrees, such as French art programs, have additional requirements to look into.\n\n\nSchools in Germany have some of the harshest restrictions for international students. Like in Spain and France, there is a pre-requisite exam. Germany requires students to have a higher education entrance qualification or the HZB (Hochschulzugangsberechtigung). Foreign students with qualifications outside the EU may have to sit a university entrance examination in Germany to be considered for application. You may also have to attend a preparatory course or a Studienkolleg before sitting the exam. Even if you meet the admission requirements, there are other rules the German university system follows called the Numerus Clasus or the NC. Some degrees are more competitive than others (architecture, medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine) in Germany, so applicants must undergo a selection process based on the restrictions of the NC. You may not be admitted to a university based on these course restrictions, so if you’re determined to attend university in Germany its best to apply to multiple universities at once. You can apply to university through either a tool called Uni-assist, which is an external tool that helps you organize the resources you need to apply in Germany, or directly through to the school itself.\n\nSchools in Australia, Japan, South Korea, and South Africa require you to apply directly to the university. There is no unified application, therefore, you must apply directly through the university.\n\nMake sure you research the application requirements for your country of choice \nthoroughly before applying.\n\nLanguage Requirements\n\nNumber two, think about the language of instruction at the university. A simple google search will usually tell you what the language of instruction is at the university. \n\nIf the language of instruction isn’t English one of two things might be true, there may be certain degrees that are taught in English (though this is often reserved for masters programs), or one of the international admission requirements may be a language proficiency exam. \n\nIf you intend to attend the university in its native language, \nthen you will be required to take a language proficiency exam. Every university requires a language proficiency exam from its international students, but if you are applying to a university that’s language of instruction is English, you can bypass the exam.\n\nInternational Students Tuition\n\nThird, think about what the cost of the university is for international students. There will most likely be a different tuition for international students versus students coming from inside the country, therefore make sure when you look at the tuition you are looking for theone for international students. The \n tuition for international students is almost always higher than that of national students\n\n\nApplying to an international university is a completely different process and its important to be well-informed about what you need to do as far ahead of time as you can. For the countries that require external exams and language proficiency exams, you need to sign up for those tests as early as possible in order to make sure you get the results before the application deadlines. It’s important to be as well prepared as possible.\n\n24/7 Teach offers courses to prepare you to ace your college applications.

Click below.\nDo You Really Need a Portfolio to Get Hired as an Instructional Designer?\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nInstructional Design Portfolio, Yes or No?\n\nIf you're navigating the ever-evolving world of instructional design, you've probably heard the buzz: \"You need a portfolio!\" Well, is it really that black and white? The short answer is both yes and no. Confused? Let's dive in.\n\nThe Portfolio Conundrum\n\nMany aspiring instructional designers conclude that building a flashy website equates to a compelling portfolio. The truth? A website doesn't necessarily showcase your expertise in instructional design. Hiring managers and clients are really interested in your skill set and the tangible results you can deliver.\n\nSkills First, Portfolio Second\n\nBefore thinking about how your portfolio will look, focus on the skills that make an instructional designer great. These skills include a deep understanding of learning theory, a systematic approach to the instructional design process, and proficiency using various instructional design authoring tools.\n\nThe What and Why of Your Portfolio\n\nYour portfolio should answer specific questions that employers or clients have:\n\nLearning Theory: Can you design courses or training that align with pedagogical, andragogical, heutagogy, geragogy, peeragogy, or cybergogy principles?\n\nInstructional Design Process: Do you follow a specific methodology like ADDIE or SAM?\n\nTool Proficiency: Can you use tools like the Articulate Suite, Adobe Suite, AI tools for design?\n\nVisual Design: Do you understand visual design principles that make content engaging?\n\nProblem-Solving: Can you tailor learning experiences to solve specific problems or achieve unique objectives?\n\nThe 24/7 Teach Success Story\n\nHere's where the 'no-portfolio-needed' part comes in. One of our boot camp participants, a transitioning teacher, landed not one but three instructional design job offers without a portfolio. How? Our Instructional Design Boot Camp with Job Guarantee emphasizes real-world skills and experiences over flashy portfolio presentations. Employers could see the value in his methodology, problem-solving capabilities, and growth potential—no portfolio needed.\n\nGetting Your First Job in Instructional Design\n\nIs it hard to get into instructional design? Not if you approach it the right way. The key is to gain experience, even if it's on a volunteer basis initially. Each project you undertake adds to your portfolio and gives you another bullet point on your resume. And don't forget about creating an effective instructional design portfolio.\n\nNecessary Credentials\n\nA portfolio can undoubtedly be a golden ticket, but what about credentials? Ideally, a blend of formal education, industry certifications, and real-world experience can make you an irresistible candidate. Our boot camp covers all these aspects comprehensively.\n\nThe Portfolio Conundrum: More Than Just a Pretty Face\n\nYou may be tempted to hire a web designer and create a dazzling online portfolio. While that might capture attention, it often glosses over the core of what makes an instructional designer valuable: the ability to solve problems and facilitate effective learning experiences. Your portfolio should serve as a testament to your skills, not just your aesthetic sense.\n\nSkills First, Portfolio Second: The Three Pillars\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nHaving a grip on various authoring tools like the Articulate Suite, Adobe Suite, Camtasia, and even understanding learning management systems (LMS) can set you apart. Knowing when and how to use these tools in different situations is equally important.\n\nLearning Theory\n\nA portfolio that doesn't reflect a sound understanding of learning theories is a red flag for employers. Are you applying Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction? Or perhaps using the SAM model for agile development? Your choice of methodology should resonate throughout your portfolio.\n\nSoft Skills\n\nBelieve it or not, being an instructional designer is not just about designing. Effective communication, project management, and stakeholder negotiation are vital. Your portfolio should, in some way, demonstrate your prowess in these areas, whether through case studies or testimonials.\n\nThe What and Why of Your Portfolio: Detail Matters\n\nEvery element you include should serve a purpose. This is where you delve into the 'why' behind each of your designs. Did you create a branching scenario? Explain your rationale and how it aligns with the learning objectives. Did you opt for video over text? Justify this choice. Your decision-making process can often be as valuable as the end result.\n\nThe 24/7 Teach Success Story: Skills Over Portfolio\n\nWhile we recommend building a portfolio, we've seen firsthand that it's not an absolute requirement. Skills can sometimes trump portfolio, especially if you can demonstrate your capabilities in real-time or during an interview process. Our boot camp participant is a testament to that.\n\nGetting Your First Job in Instructional Design: Actionable Steps\n\nStarting a career in instructional design can seem daunting, but it's more about strategic steps than monumental leaps. Volunteering for small projects, contributing to open-source eLearning modules, or even taking up internships can provide you with experience and work samples. This way, you're not only building a portfolio but also gaining much-needed experience in the industry.\n\nNecessary Credentials: A Multi-Faceted Approach\n\nWhile a strong portfolio can open doors, credentials solidify your standing in the industry. Consider pursuing certifications in project management or specialized tools. Stay updated with the latest trends through continuous learning. 24/7 Teach’s Instructional Design  Boot Camp is an excellent place to start.\n\nClosing Thoughts: The Balanced Equation\n\nIn the grand scheme, your portfolio is just a part of the equation. A robust skill set, proven experience, and the ability to articulate your expertise will set you on the path to a successful career in instructional design. If done right, your portfolio is the icing on the cake—sweet but not the entire meal.\n\nSo, there you go, an even more in-depth look into whether you genuinely need a portfolio to get hired as an instructional designer. And remember, if you need a one-stop shop to get your skills up to par, look no further than 24/7 Teach's Instructional Design Boot Camp.\n\nBy putting skills and experience first, you'll find that building a portfolio becomes a natural extension of your professional journey rather than a hurdle to clear.

Click below.\nHow to Be a Great Instructional Designer Who Gets Hired Every Time\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nHow to Be a Great Instructional Designer: \n\nThe field of instructional design is ever-evolving, catering to varied learner needs while embracing technological innovations. Being great at instructional design is not a single-skill job; it's an amalgamation of diverse competencies from technical prowess to soft skills and a deep understanding of learning theory. In today's competitive market, how can you be the kind of instructional designer in constant demand? Here's a deep dive into the critical skills and attitudes that will make you not just employable but virtually irreplaceable.\n\nTechnical Skills: Mastering the Tools of the Trade\n\nToday's instructional designers need a solid grasp of multiple authoring tools and platforms such as the Articulate Suite, Adobe Creative Cloud, Camtasia, and various Learning Management Systems (LMS). It's not just about knowing how to use them but understanding which one is best suited for specific learning experiences and project objectives. For example, an Articulate Storyline might be ideal for creating interactive eLearning modules, while Adobe's suite might be better for high-end visual content.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to keep up with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, which is becoming a game-changer in personalized learning. The key here is not just to be a passive consumer of these technologies but a lifelong learner, continually updating your skill set to stay ahead of industry trends.\n\nLearning Theory: The Backbone of Instructional Design\n\nAs an instructional designer, your primary role is to facilitate learning. Understanding instructional design models like ADDIE, SAM, Action Mapping, Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, and the Dick and Carey Model helps structure effective learning experiences. You should know when to use which model based on your project's and learners' specific needs.\n\nAssessment Design and Performance Objectives\n\nUnderstanding how to develop various types of assessments is crucial. Assessments should measure whether learners can apply what they've learned in real-world situations, whether you're designing multiple-choice questions or performance-based tasks.\n\nCreating Differentiation\n\nYour design should accommodate diverse learning styles and abilities. This means incorporating various instructional methods and materials that allow for different learning paths, particularly when teaching intricate processes and procedures.\n\nSoft Skills: The Glue that Holds Everything Together\n\nRelationship Building and Team Collaboration\n\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of being an effective instructional designer is the ability to build relationships. Your ability to collaborate effectively is crucial whether it's with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), project managers, or learners.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nYou will need to communicate complex ideas, whether explaining the importance of a learning objective to an SME or discussing project timelines with a manager. Your success will hinge on your ability to design instruction and communicate your design rationale convincingly.\n\nDecision-Making and Negotiation Skills\n\nSometimes, you'll find yourself at a crossroads, and making the right choice can be difficult. Whether deciding the best instructional strategy or negotiating the scope of a project, your ability to make and communicate decisions will be key.\n\nConflict Resolution\n\nInevitably, you will face disagreements in viewpoints, particularly with SMEs or stakeholders who have strong opinions. Knowing how to resolve conflicts respectfully and efficiently is an invaluable skill.\n\nDemonstrating Your Value\n\nThe ability to articulate your expertise and your value to a project is critical, particularly in freelance or consulting roles. Whether through a well-curated portfolio, strong client testimonials, or clearly outlined case studies, ensure you can demonstrate your worth effectively.\n\nDealing with Difficult Stakeholders\n\nNot every project will run smoothly. You might encounter stakeholders who are hard to please or who have conflicting interests. Your soft skills, particularly in conflict resolution and communication, will be paramount here. Always aim to find a middle ground that doesn't compromise the instructional integrity of the project.\n\nThe Competitive Edge: Lifelong Learning and Adaptability\n\nWhile the skills mentioned above form the core of what makes an instructional designer great, it's essential to note that the field is continually changing. What worked yesterday might be obsolete tomorrow, and the only way to keep up is through a commitment to lifelong learning.\n\nKeeping Your Skills Updated\n\nRegularly participate in professional development activities, including online courses, webinars, or industry conferences. Join instructional design forums and online communities to share and learn from your peers. Consume research papers, articles, and case studies that provide valuable insights into best practices and emerging trends.\n\nAdaptability: The Invisible Skill\n\nThe ability to adapt is an under-acknowledged skill. Projects will change scope, technologies will update, and what stakeholders want can shift overnight. Adaptability means not just coping with change but leveraging it as an opportunity for learning and growth.\n\nBuilding a Portfolio that Speaks Volumes\n\nYour portfolio is not just a collection of your past work; it's a dynamic tool that should evolve as you do. Each project you add should demonstrate your growing expertise and breadth of skills. Your portfolio should speak to your ability to execute a project and conceive, manage, and adapt it based on changing requirements and learner feedback.\n\nTime Management and Prioritization\n\nAs an instructional designer, you'll often find yourself juggling multiple tasks, such as data analysis, content development, and stakeholder meetings, to name a few. Knowing how to prioritize these tasks is critical. Use project management tools and techniques to keep track of deadlines and deliverables to ensure you're always on top of your game.\n\nBuilding a Network\n\nYou're as strong as your network in any industry. Connect with professionals in instructional design and related fields like educational technology, corporate training, and academia. A broad network can provide you with job opportunities and different perspectives and expertise that can enrich your work.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBeing a great instructional designer who gets hired every time is no small feat. It requires a well-rounded skill set encompassing technical know-how, an in-depth understanding of learning theory, and a range of soft skills from effective communication to conflict resolution. More importantly, it requires the attitude of a lifelong learner, ever-curious and adaptive, who sees challenges as opportunities to grow.\n\nRemember, the journey to becoming a great instructional designer is just that—a journey. There will be bumps along the way, but each is an opportunity for growth and learning. The skills and attitudes outlined in this article will serve as your roadmap, guiding you through the diverse and ever-changing landscape of instructional design. It's a field ripe with opportunities for those willing to put in the effort to be truly great.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nWhat specific communication techniques have you found most effective when negotiating with difficult stakeholders in instructional design, and how did these techniques contribute to the project's success?\n\nNeed Guidance on Navigating the Shift to Instructional Design?\nSCHEDULE A FREE STRATEGY CALL WITH AN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN - ADMISSIONS SPECIALIST →\nBefore You Go...\nDiscover the Unmatched 24/7 Teach Experience:\n\nOur Instructional Design bootcamps and career coaching services have a 100% success rate.

Click below.\nMastering SME Interviews: Top 30 Questions for Effective eLearning Content Development\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nMastering SME Interviews by asking the right questions:\n\nAs a lead instructional designer, one of the critical phases in developing impactful eLearning content involves engaging with subject-matter experts (SMEs) and project stakeholders. The information extracted during these interactions is pivotal in shaping the course to meet both educational and business objectives. However, this process can be challenging, particularly when transforming raw information into engaging eLearning modules. In this post, I'll share a comprehensive list of 30 targeted questions to ask SMEs and project stakeholders and the specific situations where each question is most effective.  \n\nWe will start off with my top seven or “Go-to” questions to ask:\n\nWhat challenges will this learning experience help the organization overcome, or what opportunities will it help capitalize on? \n\nWhat general knowledge, tasks, and skills are needed?\n\nWhat little challenges do you expect for the learner?\n\nWhat crisis should the learner be prepared for?\n\nWhat challenges did you (as the SME) have?\n\nIs there something I need to know that I don't already know about this information or your needs for this learning experience?\n\nHow would you explain this topic or process to an 8-year-old?\n\nThen, I have your more formal questions and when to ask them.\n\nUnderstanding the Context and Content:\n\nWhat business need or learning objective does this project address?\nSituation: Use this at the beginning to understand the overarching goal.\n\nCan you provide existing materials related to the topic?\nSituation: When you need to review current content and understand the baseline.\n\nWhat general knowledge, tasks, and skills are needed for this topic?\nSituation: To grasp the scope and depth of the content required.\n\nWhat are the typical challenges learners face regarding this topic?\nSituation: Identifying pain points helps tailor the content to address specific learner difficulties.\n\nWhat crisis situations should the content prepare the learner for?\nSituation: When creating content for high-stakes scenarios.\n\nWhat were your personal challenges when you learned this subject?\nSituation: To add personal insights and experiences to the content.\n\nWhat might I not know about this topic that is crucial?\nSituation: To uncover any hidden yet essential aspects of the subject.\n\nWhat areas typically cause confusion?\nSituation: Identifying topics that require clearer explanation or emphasis.\n\nWhat are the most common questions you receive about this topic?\nSituation: To address FAQs within the eLearning content.\n\nWhat are common mistakes made in this area?\nSituation: To develop content that preempts and corrects frequent errors.\n\nWhat are the dangerous mistakes in this area, and their impacts?\nSituation: For content focusing on safety or critical processes.\n\nWhat are the gaps between ideal practices and actual practices?\nSituation: To develop content that bridges practical gaps.\n\nCan you provide stories or examples to illustrate key points?\nSituation: To enrich the content with real-life scenarios.\n\nWhich points might meet resistance or pushback?\nSituation: Preparing to address potential learner objections or concerns.\n\nIf learners remember only three things from this, what should they be?\nSituation: Identifying the most crucial takeaways.\n\nWhat needs to be known thoroughly, without reference?\nSituation: To highlight content requiring memorization.\n\nWhat is essential but infrequently used?\nSituation: To determine what can be included as supplementary material.\n\nAre there checklists or guides that support this topic?\nSituation: To incorporate practical tools or resources.\n\nWhat information is nice-to-know but not critical?\nSituation: To decide on additional content that could enrich learning without overwhelming learners.\n\nWhat revolutionary changes or updates does this topic have?\nSituation: To update the course with the latest developments or practices.\n\nDeepening the Content:\n\nHow can this content be applied to on-the-job performance?\nSituation: Making the content practical and relevant.\n\nWhat instructional method do you think works best for this topic?\nSituation: Gaining insights into potentially effective teaching strategies.\n\nHow has this information evolved over time?\nSituation: To provide learners with a historical perspective or trend analysis.\n\nWhat are the long-term benefits of mastering this topic?\nSituation: To motivate learners by showing the value of the content.\n\nCan this content be segmented into distinct modules or sections?\nSituation: When planning the structure and flow of the course.\n\nHow would you assess the understanding of this topic?\nSituation: To design effective assessments or knowledge checks.\n\nWhat additional resources can supplement this learning?\nSituation: To provide learners with additional materials for deeper understanding.\n\nWhat mistakes did you make while learning this, and how did you overcome them?\nSituation: To humanize the learning process and share coping strategies.\n\nHow do you keep updated with the latest developments in this field?\nSituation: To guide learners on staying current post-training.\n\nWhat feedback have you received about this topic from previous training sessions?\nSituation: To improve upon past iterations of the training.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a new instructional designer, it is important to master the art of communicating effectively with SMEs and project stakeholders. Asking the right questions can help you to build a strong relationship with your SME and gain valuable insights. This can help you to create coherent, engaging, and impactful e-learning content from raw, often disjointed information. While these questions can be asked via email, it is best to ask them in person or over video conference. \n\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that just because you ask a question doesn't mean you will get the answer you need. You need to tailor these questions to your specific context to extract the most relevant and useful information. This will ensure that your eLearning courses achieve the desired performance outcomes and provide a rewarding learning experience.\n\nAsking the right questions to your SME or project stakeholders can be intimidating, but it is a major part of your responsibilities as an instructional designer. It is a skill that requires practice. By mastering the art of asking the right questions at the right time and getting effective answers, you can become a master of SME/Stakeholder interviews.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nWhat specific challenges have you faced when interviewing SMEs for eLearning content development, and how did the questions you asked help you overcome these challenges?

Click below.\nElevating eLearning Through Immersive Scenarios: A Comprehensive Guide\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nLeveraging Scenarios in eLearning: \n\nIn the digital age, where information is readily accessible, eLearning has become essential in education and corporate training. As a seasoned instructional designer, I've observed that amidst the vast array of resources and methodologies available, immersive scenarios set apart an effective eLearning course from one that merely exists without impact. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore scenarios in eLearning, offering insights into when, how, and why to use them for maximum effectiveness.\n\nThe Power of Immersive Scenarios\n\nScenarios are not mere aesthetic enhancements or interactive gimmicks. They are fundamental training tools capable of transporting learners into realistic environments that mirror their work settings. This immersive approach enables learners to learn from experience, practice, and internalize knowledge, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, especially in corporate training.\n\nWhy Use Scenarios?\n\nRealism: They create relatable, real-life-like situations for learners.\n\nInteractivity: They involve active participation, making learning engaging.\n\nFeedback Mechanism: Instant feedback helps learners understand the implications of their choices.\n\nSafe Environment: They provide a risk-free space for learners to practice skills.\n\nEngagement Boosters: Multimedia elements keep learners invested in the content.\n\nBranching Paths: Different outcomes based on choices simulate real-life decision-making consequences.\n\nNarrative-driven: Stories drive emotional engagement, making learning memorable.\n\nUtilizing Immersive Scenarios Effectively:\n\nTo maximize the impact of eLearning scenarios, it's crucial to use them purposefully and contextually. Each type of scenario serves a specific purpose and is suitable for certain topics or audiences.\n\n1) Simulation-Based Scenario\n\nDefinition: Simulation-based scenarios create virtual environments for decision-making and facing consequences in a safe setting.\n\nIdeal Use:\n\nWhen practice in a real environment is risky or costly.\n\nTo expose learners to rare or complex situations.\n\nFor developing decision-making skills.\n\nExample:\n\nIn customer service training, learners can play the role of a representative handling customer complaints and practicing communication and problem-solving skills.\n\n2) Story-Based Scenario\n\nDefinition: These scenarios weave instructional content into a narrative with characters and challenges related to the course topic.\n\nImplementation:\n\nIntroduce relatable characters and realistic conflicts.\n\nCreate decision points that impact the storyline.\n\nProvide feedback that reflects the consequences of choices.\n\nUsage Guidelines:\n\nIdeal for complex or abstract topics.\n\nTo foster empathy and emotional connection.\n\nTo enhance long-term retention of information.\n\n3) Case Study Scenario\n\nDefinition: Case studies present detailed accounts of specific situations or challenges for critical analysis and learning.\n\nStructure:\n\nIntroduction of the situation with context and data.\n\nPresentation of a central problem or challenge.\n\nProvision of evidence and data for analysis.\n\nDecision points for learner interaction.\n\nConclusion with real-world outcomes or expert insights.\n\nUsage:\n\nTo encourage analytical and decision-making skills.\n\nFor complex topics requiring deep reflection and discussion.\n\nTo provide practical context to theoretical knowledge.\n\n4) Exploratory Scenario\n\nDefinition: Exploratory scenarios offer interactive environments where learners can engage with various elements to learn actively.\n\nKey Features:\n\nInteractive and immersive digital landscapes.\n\nFreedom for learners to choose their learning path.\n\nEmbedded challenges and instant feedback.\n\nLayered information for in-depth exploration.\n\nIdeal Use:\n\nFor detailed or complex topics requiring hands-on practice.\n\nTo promote learner autonomy and engagement.\n\nTo cater to self-directed learning styles.\n\nDesigning Effective Scenarios:\n\nCreating impactful scenarios in eLearning requires more than just technical skills; it demands creativity, a deep understanding of learner psychology, and an awareness of the educational objectives. Here are some steps to ensure your scenarios are effective:\n\nUnderstand Your Audience: Tailor your scenarios to the specific needs, backgrounds, and experiences of your learners.\n\nAlign with Learning Objectives: Ensure that each scenario directly contributes to the overall learning goals.\n\nIncorporate Realistic Elements: Use authentic situations and challenges to increase relatability and applicability.\n\nEncourage Active Participation: Design scenarios that require learners to think, decide, and act, rather than just observe.\n\nFacilitate Reflective Learning: Provide opportunities for learners to reflect on their decisions and learn from their experiences.\n\nFive Steps to creating an effective Scenario:\n\n1. Know Your Audience\n\nThe foundation of any successful instructional design lies in understanding your learners. Before diving into the course design, you must know who you are designing for. This is where empathy plays a crucial role. You need to understand your audience's level of expertise, their expectations from the learning experience, and their aspirations.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nDetermining Prior Knowledge: Understanding whether your learners are novices or experienced professionals helps tailor the complexity and depth of the scenarios.\n\nAligning with Learner Aspirations: People engage better when the learning aligns with their personal and professional goals. Knowing their aspirations helps in creating scenarios that resonate with them.\n\n2. Identify the Learning Objectives\n\nThe next critical step is defining clear learning objectives. These objectives should reflect both the learners' needs and the organizational goals.\n\nFocus Areas:\n\nBridging Learning Gaps: Identify the skills or knowledge gaps that the eLearning course aims to fill.\n\nBusiness Alignment: Ensure that the learning objectives align with the broader organizational goals, making the training relevant and valuable.\n\n3. Choose the Best-Suited Situation for a Scenario\n\nWith a comprehensive understanding of your audience and clear learning objectives, select real-life situations that effectively reflect the learning gaps. Prioritize scenarios based on their frequency and impact on the organization.\n\nSelecting Scenarios:\n\nRelevance: Choose situations that are most relevant and common in the learners' work environment.\n\nLearning Potential: Assess the situations for their potential to create engaging, interactive, and conflict-rich scenarios conducive to learning.\n\n4. Pick the Right Scenario Frame\n\nSelecting the appropriate type of scenario is critical for the effectiveness of the training. Each scenario type is suited for teaching different skills:\n\nTypes of Scenarios:\n\nSkill-Based: Ideal for demonstrating specific skills or knowledge, often following a theoretical session.\n\nProblem-Based: Best for scenarios requiring decision-making and critical thinking.\n\nIssue-Based: Focuses on broader issues, encouraging learners to understand complex, multifaceted situations.\n\nSpeculative: Asks learners to predict future outcomes based on current knowledge.\n\nGaming: Utilizes game elements to create an engaging learning environment.\n\n5. Design the Scenario\n\nThe final step is the actual creation of the scenario. This involves crafting a narrative that is engaging and educationally effective.\n\nDesign Considerations:\n\nTrigger Event: Design an event that realistically initiates the scenario, reflecting the learners' real-world experiences.\n\nRelatable Protagonist: Create a protagonist that learners can identify with, ensuring that their actions and decisions resonate with the target audience.\n\nFeedback as a Learning Tool: Integrate feedback within the scenario to guide learners, offering explanations for mistakes, and exploring the consequences of different decisions.\n\nTips for Effective Scenario Design:\n\nKeep It Realistic: Ensure that the scenarios are authentic and mirror the challenges learners face in their jobs.\n\nMake It Interactive: Incorporate decision points and branching narratives to foster active engagement.\n\nLeverage Storytelling: Use compelling narratives to make the learning experience memorable.\n\nPositive and Constructive Feedback: Feedback should be instructional yet encouraging, helping learners understand and learn from their choices.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nCreativity and analysis are at the heart of instructional design, especially when it comes to scenario-based learning. While it's essential to keep the design process structured and focused on the objectives, infusing creativity in your scenarios will make the learning experience captivating and impactful. By following these five steps, you ensure not just the relevance but also the effectiveness of your eLearning courses. Remember, the goal is to create scenarios that not only engage learners but also facilitate the practical application of skills in their day-to-day work. With thoughtful design and execution, scenario-based eLearning can become a powerful tool in your instructional design arsenal, bridging the gap between theory and practice, and transforming the eLearning experience.\"\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nHow have you effectively integrated scenarios in your eLearning designs, and what specific impact have they had on learner engagement and knowledge retention?

Click below.\nNavigating the Needs Analysis in Instructional Design: A Comprehensive Guide\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nPrint the Article\n\nNeeds Analysis in Instructional Design: \n\nThe journey of creating impactful and effective learning experiences begins with a crucial step: the needs analysis. This foundational phase in the instructional design process allows designers to uncover the real gaps between the current state of learners' knowledge or skills and the desired outcomes. A thorough needs analysis not only informs the direction of the instructional design but also ensures that the learning interventions are relevant, targeted, and capable of achieving the intended educational goals. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the steps involved in completing a needs analysis, offering insights and strategies to enhance the effectiveness of your instructional design projects.\n\nUnderstanding Needs Analysis:\n\nNeeds analysis, at its core, is a systematic process for identifying and analyzing the learning needs of an audience. It serves as a diagnostic tool that helps instructional designers develop a deep understanding of their learners, the context in which learning will occur, and the specific objectives that the educational program aims to achieve. By conducting a needs analysis, designers can tailor their instructional strategies to address the unique requirements of their learners, thereby maximizing the impact of the educational experience.\n\nThe Importance of Needs Analysis:\n\nSkipping the needs analysis can lead to misaligned learning objectives, irrelevant content, and instructional strategies that fail to engage or meet the learners' actual needs. In contrast, a well-conducted needs analysis:\n\nEnsures that the instructional design is learner-centered and goal-oriented.\n\nHelps in allocating resources efficiently by focusing on priority areas.\n\nFacilitates the alignment of learning objectives with organizational or educational goals.\n\nIncreases the likelihood of the educational program's success by basing decisions on data and evidence.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Conducting a Needs Analysis:\n\nCompleting a needs analysis involves several key steps, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the learning requirements. Here's how to navigate these steps effectively:\n\nStep 1: Define the Scope and Objectives\n\nBegin by clearly defining the scope of the needs analysis. Understand the broader educational or organizational goals that the learning program aims to support. Establish specific objectives for the needs analysis itself, such as identifying skill gaps, understanding learner characteristics, or assessing the effectiveness of existing training programs.\n\nStep 2: Gather Data\n\nData collection is a critical component of the needs analysis. Utilize a variety of methods to gather comprehensive information about your learners and the learning context\n\nSurveys and Questionnaires: Deploy surveys to collect quantitative and qualitative data from potential learners, instructors, and stakeholders.\n\nInterviews and Focus Groups: Conduct interviews and focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into the learners' needs, preferences, and challenges.\n\nObservations: Observe learners in their work or educational environments to identify performance gaps and contextual factors that influence learning.\n\nDocument Analysis: Review existing documentation, such as performance reviews, educational records, or curriculum guidelines, to identify learning needs and objectives.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Data\n\nWith the data in hand, the next step is to analyze it to identify patterns, trends, and specific needs. Look for discrepancies between the current state of learner knowledge or skills and the desired outcomes. Use this analysis to pinpoint the specific areas where instructional interventions are needed.\n\nStep 4: Identify Learning Objectives\n\nBased on the needs identified in the analysis, develop clear and measurable learning objectives. These objectives should directly address the gaps uncovered during the needs analysis and guide the creation of the instructional content and strategies.\n\nStep 5: Prioritize Needs\n\nNot all identified needs will have the same level of urgency or impact. Prioritize the learning needs based on factors such as the potential for improvement, alignment with goals, and resource availability. This prioritization helps in focusing the instructional design efforts on areas that will have the greatest impact.\n\nStep 6: Develop a Plan\n\nWith the needs and objectives clearly defined and prioritized, develop a detailed plan for the instructional design project. This plan should outline the instructional strategies, content, technologies, and assessment methods that will be used to address the identified needs. It should also include timelines, responsibilities, and resource requirements.\n\nStep 7: Validate and Refine\n\nBefore proceeding with the full-scale development of the learning program, validate your findings and plans with stakeholders and potential learners. Use their feedback to refine your needs analysis and instructional design plan, ensuring that it accurately reflects the learning requirements and is positioned for success.\n\nBest Practices for Effective Needs Analysis:\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the needs analysis process, consider the following best practices:\n\nEngage a Diverse Range of Stakeholders: Include perspectives from all relevant stakeholders, including learners, educators, administrators, and industry experts, to ensure a holistic understanding of the needs.\n\nUse Mixed Methods for Data Collection: Combining quantitative and qualitative data collection methods provides a more comprehensive view of the learning needs.\n\nBe Objective and Data-Driven: Base your analysis and conclusions on the data collected, avoiding assumptions or biases.\n\nContinuously Iterate: Needs analysis is not a one-time activity. Continuously collect and analyze data to refine and adjust your instructional design as needed.\n\nConclusion: The Foundation of Effective Instructional Design\n\nA thorough needs analysis is the cornerstone of effective instructional design. By systematically identifying and analyzing the learning needs of your audience, you can create educational programs that are relevant, impactful, and aligned with both learner requirements and organizational goals. This guide provides a roadmap for conducting a comprehensive needs analysis, ensuring that your instructional design efforts are grounded in a deep understanding of your learners' needs and the context in which learning occurs.

Click below.\nDeveloping Goals and Success Criteria in Instructional Design: A Roadmap to Effective Learning Outco\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nPrint the Article\n\nSuccess Criteria in Instructional Design: \n\nIn the realm of instructional design, the creation of effective learning experiences is akin to charting a course toward a defined destination. The journey's success depends on clear goals and well-defined success criteria, serving as the compass and milestones that guide both instructors and learners toward achieving meaningful outcomes. This post delves into the essence of developing goals and success criteria within instructional design, offering insights into their pivotal roles and distinctions from objectives to ensure that the end results of any course are both measurable and attainable.\n\nUnderstanding the Foundation: Goals in Instructional Design\n\nGoals in instructional design represent the broad, overarching outcomes that an educational program aims to achieve. These high-level statements convey the learning experience's intent and direction, providing a bird's-eye view of what the course seeks to accomplish. For instance, a goal might be to enhance the leadership skills of mid-level managers within an organization. Goals set the stage for more detailed planning and development in the instructional design process, serving as the foundational pillars upon which the course or training is built.\n\nDeveloping Effective Goals\n\nEffective goals in instructional design are characterized by their clarity, relevance, and alignment with the broader educational or organizational objectives. Here are steps to ensure your goals meet these criteria:\n\nAlign with Vision and Needs: Start by aligning the course goals with the educational institution's or organization's vision and the learners' needs. Conduct a needs analysis to understand the gaps between current capabilities and desired outcomes.\n\nBe Clear and Broad: Goals should be clear enough to provide direction yet broad enough to encompass the wide range of skills and knowledge areas the course or training intends to cover.\n\nEnsure Relevance: Each goal should be relevant to the learners' personal or professional growth, motivating them to engage with the course material.\n\nCrafting Success Criteria: Measuring Achievement\n\nWhile goals provide a directional path, success criteria offer concrete benchmarks by which to measure progress and achievement. Success criteria articulate what success looks like at the end of the course, detailing the specific, observable, and measurable outcomes learners should be able to demonstrate upon completing the learning journey.\n\nDeveloping Effective Success Criteria\n\nTo develop effective success criteria, instructional designers must:\n\nIdentify Key Competencies: Break down the course goals into specific competencies or skills that learners need to acquire.\n\nMake it Measurable: Ensure each criterion is quantifiable or observable. For instance, \"Learners will be able to execute a digital marketing campaign with a minimum conversion rate of 5%.\"\n\nAlign with Assessment Strategies: Success criteria should directly align with the methods used to assess learners' performance, ensuring a clear pathway from learning activities to assessment outcomes.\n\nThe Difference Between Objectives and Success Criteria\n\nWhile the terms \"objectives\" and \"success criteria\" are often used interchangeably in educational contexts, they hold distinct meanings in instructional design.\n\nObjectives: The Step-by-Step Guide to Achievement\n\nObjectives are specific, measurable statements that describe what learners will be able to do as a result of instruction. They break down the goals into actionable, learner-centered tasks, providing a clear roadmap for both instruction and assessment. Objectives are the stepping stones that lead learners towards achieving the broader goals of the course.\n\nSuccess Criteria: The Benchmark of Success\n\nSuccess criteria, on the other hand, define the standards by which objectives can be measured. They are the benchmarks that indicate whether the learning objectives—and, by extension, the course goals—have been met. Success criteria answer the question, \"How will we know that learners have successfully achieved the objectives?\"\n\nImplementing Goals and Success Criteria in Instructional Design\n\nImplementing effective goals and success criteria in instructional design involves a systematic approach, from the initial planning phase to the assessment of learning outcomes. Here's a roadmap to guide this process:\n\nDefine Broad Goals: Begin by establishing clear, relevant, and aligned goals that reflect the desired outcomes of the course.\n\nDevelop Learning Objectives: Break down the goals into specific learning objectives that articulate what learners need to do to achieve these goals.\n\nCraft Success Criteria: For each objective, define success criteria that detail how the achievement of these objectives will be measured.\n\nDesign Learning Activities and Assessments: Create learning activities and assessments that align with the objectives and success criteria, ensuring that learners have the opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of the content.\n\nEvaluate and Revise: After implementing the course, evaluate the learners' performance against the success criteria. Use this data to revise the course content, learning activities, and assessment methods as needed to improve outcomes.\n\nLet's expand our discussion by examining additional considerations and advanced techniques for crafting goals and success criteria that resonate with learners and stakeholders alike.\n\nIntegrating Stakeholder Feedback:\n\nIn the development of goals and success criteria, stakeholder feedback plays a pivotal role. Engaging with diverse stakeholders—including learners, educators, subject matter experts, and industry professionals—can provide invaluable insights into the relevance and feasibility of the goals set for a course. This collaborative approach ensures that the learning experience is aligned with the needs and expectations of all parties involved.\n\nConduct Focus Groups: Gather input from potential learners and instructors to understand their expectations and identify any gaps in existing offerings.\n\nLeverage Industry Insights: Consult with industry professionals to ensure the goals and success criteria are relevant and current with current standards and practices.\n\nEmphasizing Learner-Centered Design\n\nLearner-centered design is paramount in instructional design. This approach places the learners at the core of the course development process, tailoring the learning experience to their needs, preferences, and contexts. By focusing on the learners, instructional designers can create goals and success criteria that are not only meaningful but also motivating for the learners.\n\nDevelop Personas: Create detailed learner personas to represent the diverse backgrounds, skills, and learning preferences of your target audience. Use these personas to guide the development of goals and success criteria.\n\nIncorporate Learner Feedback: Use surveys, interviews, and pilot tests to gather feedback from learners on the draft goals and success criteria. This iterative feedback loop allows for adjustments that can enhance the relevance and impact of the learning experience.\n\nLeveraging Technology and Data\n\nThe integration of technology and data analytics offers powerful tools for refining goals and success criteria. Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other educational technologies can provide actionable insights into learner behavior, engagement, and performance.\n\nAnalyze Learning Data: Utilize data analytics to monitor learner progress and identify patterns or challenges in achieving the set criteria. This data can inform revisions to the learning objectives, content, and instructional strategies.\n\nAdaptive Learning Pathways: Implement adaptive learning technologies that adjust the learning experience based on individual learner performance. This approach ensures that the success criteria are met by providing personalized support and resources.\n\nAligning with Educational Standards and Competencies\n\nAligning course goals and success criteria with established educational standards and competencies ensures that the learning experience is both credible and transferable. This alignment is particularly important in professional development and accreditation contexts.\n\nReference National and International Standards: Incorporate relevant educational standards into the development of goals and success criteria to ensure that the course meets recognized benchmarks of quality and rigor.\n\nMap Competencies: Clearly map the learning objectives and success criteria to professional competencies. This alignment helps learners see the direct application and value of their learning in professional contexts.\n\nContinuous Improvement and Evaluation\n\nThe development of goals and success criteria is not a one-time effort but part of an ongoing process of evaluation and refinement. Continuous improvement ensures that the instructional design remains dynamic, responsive, and effective over time.\n\nImplement Formative Assessments: Use formative assessments throughout the course to gather ongoing feedback on learner achievement relative to the success criteria. This feedback can guide immediate adjustments to instruction and support.\n\nReview and Revise Regularly: The goals and success criteria should be reviewed regularly, based on new data, feedback, and changing contexts. This proactive approach ensures that the course continues to effectively meet the needs of learners and stakeholders.\n\nConclusion: Charting the Path to Success\n\nThe meticulous development of goals and success criteria is the cornerstone of effective instructional design. By integrating stakeholder feedback, focusing on learner-centered design, leveraging technology and data, aligning with standards and competencies, and committing to continuous improvement, instructional designers can create learning experiences that are not only impactful but also adaptive to the evolving landscape of education and professional development.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of designing meaningful and effective learning experiences, let us remember that the journey towards educational success is a collaborative and iterative process. By placing the goals and success criteria at the heart of instructional design, we ensure that every course not only reaches its destination but also empowers learners to embark on their own paths of discovery, growth, and achievement.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nIn the context of instructional design, how can the integration of stakeholder feedback and learner-centered design principles enhance the effectiveness of goals and success criteria?

Click below.\nThe Essence of Visual Design in Learning: A Practical Guide\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n\nPrint the Article\n\nThe Essence of Visual Design in Learning\n\nAt the heart of eLearning is a simple truth: our brains are wired to process visual information far more effectively than text alone. A well-designed course can transform a mundane learning experience into an engaging, memorable adventure. Imagine a course that uses visuals not just as decoration but as a critical component of storytelling and knowledge transfer. Every element enhances comprehension and retention, from infographics that simplify complex data to animations that bring concepts to life.\n\nCommon Missteps in eLearning Visual Design:\n\nThe Sin of Ignorance: Overlooking Design Impact\n\nVisual design is not just about making things look pretty; it's about communication. Every element, from logos to color schemes, tells a story. Neglecting this aspect can result in a disengaged audience. A course that looks good but fails to communicate effectively is like a book with a beautiful cover but empty pages.\n\nDissonance: Failing to Unify Content and Design\n\nThe unity between design and content is sacred. It's the harmony that ensures the message is not just seen but felt. Imagine learning about the calmness of meditation through a cluttered, chaotic design. The message loses its essence. Creating a seamless blend of content and design ensures that learners are not just absorbing information but experiencing it.\n\nA Palette of Errors: Poor Design Choices\n\nEvery color, font, and image in eLearning shapes the learner's experience. Inappropriate use of these elements can distract and even confuse. For instance, using a futuristic font for a history course might look cool, but does it convey the right message? Tailoring design elements to match the content and audience preferences is vital to crafting an immersive learning experience.\n\nPrinciples for Exquisite Visual Design in eLearning\n\nBalance: The Equilibrium of Elements\n\nBalance in design brings stability and structure. It's about arranging elements to feel right through symmetry or an intentional asymmetry that guides the learner's eye across the screen. Imagine a scale where each side holds design elements in perfect harmony, creating a sense of peace and order.\n\nAlignment: The Invisible Grid\n\nAlignment turns a random collection of elements into a coherent unit. The silent guideline brings order to chaos, ensuring that every text block, image, and button is in its rightful place, contributing to a clean and professional look.\n\nHierarchy: The Art of Focus\n\nHierarchy is the spotlight, directing the learner's attention to what's essential. It's about using size, color, and placement to signal the order in which information should be consumed. Like a maestro conducting an orchestra, hierarchy controls the tempo and flow of the viewer's journey through the content.\n\nContrast: The Dance of Differences\n\nContrast is the drama of design, the play of light and dark, bold and subtle, that captures attention and emphasizes key points. It's about creating focal points that guide learners through the content, making the learning experience visually engaging and easy to navigate.\n\nRhythm: The Visual Symphony\n\nRhythm in design is about creating patterns or sequences that enhance the visual experience, making the content more digestible and engaging. The repetition of elements creates a sense of movement, easily leading the learner through the course.\n\nThe Elements of Visual Design:\nThe Role of Color in Learning\n\nColor is more than an aesthetic choice; it's a powerful communication tool. It can influence mood, convey messages, and even impact learning effectiveness. The strategic use of color can highlight key concepts, differentiate sections, and guide learners through a course intuitively. For instance, warm colors like red and orange can energize and grab attention, while cool colors like blue and green promote calmness and concentration.\n\nThe Emotional Resonance of Color\n\nThe psychology of color plays a pivotal role in visual design, influencing perceptions and emotions. Colors have the power to evoke feelings, from the tranquility of blue to the energetic vibrancy of yellow. Imagine an eLearning course on stress management bathed in soft blues and greens, creating a serene backdrop that embodies tranquility. Contrast this with a course on entrepreneurship, where vibrant reds and yellows spark excitement and innovation. Each palette tells a story, setting the stage for the learning journey ahead.\n\nAdvice:\n\nUnderstanding the emotional weight of colors and their cultural connotations ensures that our designs speak to learners on a deeper, more intuitive level.\n\nTypography: The Voice of Your Content\n\nTypography, the choice of fonts and text styling, is the voice of your content. It's not just about readability; it's about personality, emphasis, and setting the tone. The right typography can make the content accessible and engaging, while the wrong choice can be distracting or even off-putting.\n\nAdvice:\n\nThe right typeface can elevate the legibility of your text, but it also sets the tone. Consider the difference between a serif font, which might evoke a sense of tradition and reliability, and a sans-serif font, which often feels modern and clean. Using these stylistic differences strategically can enhance the learning experience. For example, a history course might leverage a serif font to convey a sense of timelessness, while a course on digital marketing might opt for a sans-serif font to reflect the contemporary nature of the subject.\n\nImagery: A Thousand Words\n\nThe use of imagery extends beyond decorative purposes, serving as a powerful tool for explaining abstract concepts through visual metaphors. A complex idea like \"network security\" might be represented by a fortress, translating the concept into a visual form that is instantly recognizable and relatable. This technique not only aids in comprehension but also enhances memory retention by anchoring concepts in vivid imagery. Selecting or creating images that serve as metaphors requires a deep understanding of the subject matter and creativity, making the design process both an analytical and artistic endeavor.\n\nAdvice:\n\nTo harness the full power of imagery, consider using real photos over staged stock images, incorporating infographics to explain complex data, or employing illustrations to add a creative touch to abstract concepts. For instance, an eLearning course on environmental science might use powerful images of nature to connect learners emotionally to the subject matter, making the learning experience more impactful and memorable.\n\nInteractivity: Engaging the Learner\n\nVisual design in eLearning isn't static; it's an interactive canvas that invites learners to engage, explore, and participate. Interactive elements like clickable hotspots, drag-and-drop activities, and simulations incorporate visual design principles to create a dynamic learning environment. These elements not only break the monotony of passive learning but also provide practical experience and immediate feedback, which are crucial for effective learning. \n\nAdvice:\n\nDesigning interactivity requires a balance between aesthetic appeal and functionality, ensuring that visual elements enhance usability and contribute to the learning objectives.\n\nImagine a project management course that includes interactive scenarios in which learners must make decisions based on real-life challenges. These activities not only reinforce learning but also develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparing learners for real-world applications.\n\nAccessibility: Designing for All Learners\n\nAccessibility must be a guiding principle in the pursuit of effective visual design. Designing for accessibility ensures that all learners, regardless of disability, can access and benefit from the eLearning experience. This includes considering color contrast for those with visual impairments, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring that interactive elements are navigable with keyboard commands.\n\nCreating accessible designs means that eLearning courses are inclusive, reaching a wider audience and providing equal opportunities for learning. It's about creating a learning environment where everyone, with their diverse needs and preferences, feels valued and supported.\n\nStorytelling: The Narrative Power of Visuals\n\nVisual design in eLearning can transcend the mere presentation of information, elevating it to the realm of storytelling. A well-crafted visual narrative can guide learners through a course, creating an emotional connection and a memorable learning journey. This could involve a character that learners follow through different scenarios, a thematic visual motif that evolves with the course content, or a consistent visual style that ties the entire course together. Storytelling through design requires artistic skill and the ability to weave elements of narrative, emotion, and information into a cohesive whole.\n\nPractical Application: \nEmbracing Moderation: The Golden Mean of Information Delivery\n\nIn the realm of eLearning, finding the right balance of information presentation is crucial. Cognitive Load Theory reminds us that the human brain has a limited capacity for processing new information at any given time. Overloading learners with too much information can overwhelm them, making it difficult to absorb and retain knowledge. Conversely, too little information can lead to disengagement and distraction. To strike a harmonious balance, incorporate multiple learning modalities but avoid requiring learners to simultaneously process parallel streams of information. Ensure that every graphic and piece of content serves a purpose, enriching the learning experience without overburdening the learner.\n\nThe Clarity of Sans Serif Fonts:\n\nTypography plays a significant role in the legibility and accessibility of eLearning content. Sans serif fonts, known for their clean lines and simple forms, are particularly effective for screen reading. Fonts like Arial, with a recommended size of 12 points or larger, cater to a broad audience, including those who may prefer larger text. Verdana, at 10 points, offers a comfortable reading experience for situations that call for smaller text. Georgia is a suitable alternative to more ornate serif fonts for content that requires a touch of formality without sacrificing readability.\n\nNavigating the Scan Path:\n\nUnderstanding how learners visually navigate content can greatly influence the effectiveness of your eLearning course. The \"scan path\" refers to the natural movement of the eyes across a screen, typically following an F-shaped pattern. To align your course design with this pattern, employ headlines and sub-headlines as navigational aids, use bullet points and numbered lists to emphasize key information, favor shorter paragraphs for ease of reading, and utilize white space to give the eyes a rest. Colored text can also be used strategically to draw attention to important details.\n\nCohesion Through Repetitive Elements:\n\nConsistency in design reduces cognitive load by minimizing the amount of new information and helps create a cohesive learning experience. Using a consistent framing and design scheme, learners can easily recognize patterns, understand relationships between concepts, and intuitively navigate the course. \n\nAdvice: \n\nMaintain uniformity in layout, typography, and visual elements across all course materials to achieve this.\n\nPrioritize Structure Over Design:\n\nA well-structured course is the foundation of effective eLearning. Before diving into the design phase, develop a detailed plan of your course content and structure. Storyboarding is a valuable tool in this process, providing a visual outline that ensures each course element aligns with the overall learning objectives. Regularly revisiting your goals with each new slide can help keep the course focused and relevant.\n\nThe Art of Color Coordination:\n\nColor selection is another area where personal preferences can unduly influence eLearning design. While a good sense of color can lead to visually appealing courses, it's essential to base color choices on solid principles rather than subjective tastes. Familiarize yourself with the basics of color theory and explore resources like Betterment, Codrops, and Spyre Studios for inspiration and practical guidance on creating effective color schemes.\n\nGuidelines for effective visual design\n\nSo, what are these guidelines for effective visual design? Here are ten guidelines that help you emphasize the visual design in your Instructional Design.\n\nContent Copy:\n\n1. Display < 120 words at once. \n\nPage layouts should display no more than about 120 words at any time so the learning space does not become cluttered or difficult to read. If more content is needed for the topic on that page, either allow the learner to show/hide some content in the same space or break up the content into multiple pages.\n\n2. Chunk the content. \n\nThe course content should be written to aid comprehension and retention. The brain digests information quicker if it is broken into smaller sections. Rather than using one or two long paragraphs, break the content into smaller chunks of one to three sentences or use bullets to emphasize key learning points.\n\nFont Formatting: \n\n3. Size fonts for readability. \n\nAlthough font size of 10 or 11 may work well for print or emails, increasing the font to 12, 13 or 14 for the body content will make the content much easier to read for all learners. Double the font size (to 24 to 28) for section headers and step up 1 to 2 points (i.e., 12+2=14) and Bold for page headers. You want the content to be as easy as possible to read and digest- especially for adult learners with challenges viewing information on a screen.\n\n4. Use two fonts. \n\nThe formatting of the fonts support learners to understand the purpose of the text (i.e., title, subtitle, body content). Use Sans Serif fonts such as Arial, Veranda, or Tahoma for body content and subheadings since these are much easier to read on screens. Use Serif fonts such as Times, Palatino, or Garamond for titles to make them stand out.\n\nLayout: \n\n5. Incorporate white space. \n\nWhite space is a visual design concept that allows the content (whether it is words or graphics) to stand out and more readily be comprehended. White space, or negative space, doesn't need to be white, it just needs to be the color of your background and devoid of any graphics or text. White space is usually thought of as a blank space at the top, bottom, or side of the page. However, it can also be incorporated throughout the elements on a page, such as cell padding within a table or buffer areas around shapes. In blocks of text, the spacing between the lines (also referred to as \"ledding or leading\") can include white space to make reading easier. Setting line spacing to about 1.2 so allows the text 'to breathe' and makes it more visually appealing. In most authoring programs, you can manually change paragraph spacing to Exactly 16 (if your font size is 12). In addition, adding a 10-point space before each paragraph visually breaks them apart.\n\n6. Utilize guides and grids. \n\nWhen designing page layouts, employ guides to establish specific boundaries for elements such as body text, titles, graphics, and navigation elements. Most authoring tools also provide tools to set the exact location of the elements using X,Y coordinates. These coordinates refer to the number of pixels from the top left corner. For example, titles may be placed at 60,60 and subheadings below it at 60,120. Use grids to make calculating the page borders and placement of elements much easier. Grids can be toggled on or off to allow you snap objects to the grid, so your elements are arranged proportionally and are automatically aligned. Set the grid spacing to increments that are easy to work with, such as 10 points.\n\n7. Design from top left to bottom right. \n\nLearners look at a page beginning at the top left, which is the best placement for the page title. As they progress through the content, they will finish reading at the bottom right, which is an optimal place for a navigation or response button. Since Western text is read from left to right, it is read and comprehended easier if it is justified left. The eye naturally goes to the same starting place in each line for left aligned text, as opposed to different places for centered aligned text. This guideline applies to body text as well as sub headings, basically anyplace where there is multi-lined text.\n\nColor:\n\n8. Limit your color palette. \n\nChoose no more than five main colors to use throughout the course. Use lighter and darker shades of those colors as needed for accents or backgrounds. The colors should be complementary and visually attractive. There are online tools such as color scheme generators and color combination libraries to help you create a professional palette for your course. Be mindful to create enough contrast between the colors you use (especially if your course has to meet accessibility requirements). For example, if there is black text over a dark purple background, consider changing one color to increase the contrast between them to make reading easier. You can check your palette with an online contrast checker.\n\n9. Indicate meanings for colors. \n\nSometimes, colors can just be colors. However, colors can also indicate specific things to your learners. Teal might indicate a response is needed such as a 'Next, 'Play', or 'Click to Reveal' button. Very light shades of your color palette can be used for background behind text blocks while darker shades of those colors can be used for buttons. If you do decide to employ color for meaning, make sure that color has only one meaning (i.e., don't use red buttons to indicate 'Next' and a big red check to indicate wrong answers).\n\nConsistency: \n\n10. Be consistent in your visual design. \n\nThese guidelines support great visual design only if they are used consistently throughout your course. It may take some additional work up front to establish a visual style for your course- but once you do, it will provide benefits. For you, it will make design decisions in new page layouts much easier since you have a guide to help you. It will also increase efficiency since you can re-use and modify layouts for multiple sections. For the learners, the course will have a unified look and feel and basically get out of the way. The visual design allows them to focus on the content- which will be easier to read and understand.\n\nContinuous Learning and Research\n\nThe guidelines provided here are merely a starting point. The vast expanse of design in eLearning requires ongoing exploration and learning. From books to online resources, expanding your knowledge in design principles, color theory, typography, and user experience is crucial. Websites like Betterment, Codrops, and Spyre Studios offer palette samples and inspiration, serving as valuable tools for both seasoned designers and those new to the field.\n\nLet us continue to explore, learn, and apply these principles, for the harmonious blend of design and content holds the key to unlocking our learners' full potential.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 Instructional Design community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nConsidering the nuanced interplay between visual design elements and cognitive load in creating effective eLearning courses, how would you approach designing an instructional module to balance engaging visuals with the need to avoid cognitive overload?

Click below.\nWhat are Supplemental College Essays and how to write them?\n \nDownload\n\nSupplemental college essays are additional pieces of writing that colleges may require or recommend as part of your application. These essays give you the opportunity to provide additional context about your interests, experiences, and goals and to explain why you are a good fit for the college.\n\nHere are some tips for writing supplemental college essays:\n\nRead the prompt carefully: Make sure you understand what the college is asking you to write about. Look for keywords and phrases that can help you focus your essay.\n\nStart with a plan: Before you start writing, brainstorm ideas and make an outline of what you want to include in your essay. This will help you organize your thoughts and make sure you stay on topic.\n\nBe specific: Avoid vague or general statements and instead provide concrete examples and details. This will help your essay stand out and be more memorable.\n\nShow, don't tell: Instead of just listing your achievements or describing your personality, use specific anecdotes and experiences to illustrate your points. This will make your essay more engaging and believable.\n\nEdit and revise: Before you submit your essay, be sure to proofread for spelling and grammar errors and to make sure your essay is clear and well-written. You may also want to ask a friend or family member to read over your essay and give you feedback.\n\nFollow the guidelines: Make sure you follow the college's guidelines for the essay, including length, formatting, and deadline\n\nFollow the IVUA rule (Impactful, Vulnerable, Unique, Authentic): Make sure your essay is authentic, impactful for the reader, and shows vulnerability.  The most famous entertainers and historical figures were revered because of their ability to connect with their audience through impact, vulnerability, uniqueness, and authenticity. \n\nHere are some potential prompts for a supplemental college essay:\n\nDescribe a time when you faced a challenge or obstacle and how you overcame it.\n\nDiscuss a person who has had a significant influence on you and how they have shaped your life.\n\nDescribe a time when you took a risk or did something outside of your comfort zone.\n\nShare an experience that has helped you to better understand and appreciate diversity.\n\nDiscuss a book, film, or piece of art that has had a significant impact on you and why.\n\nDescribe a time when you demonstrated leadership or worked as part of a team to achieve a common goal.\n\nDiscuss a subject or idea you are passionate about and how you have pursued this interest.\n\nShare a personal accomplishment that you are particularly proud of and why.\n\nDescribe a time when you faced a difficult ethical dilemma and how you navigated the situation.\n\nShare a personal experience that has shaped your values or perspective on life.\n\nRemember to tailor your essay to the specific requirements and goals of the college you are applying to and to focus on demonstrating your unique qualities and experiences. It's also important, to be honest, and authentic in your writing, and to avoid trying to impress the admissions committee with overly formal or grandiose language.\n\nWriting supplemental college essays can be a challenging but rewarding experience, and they can be a great way to showcase your personality and goals to the college.

Click below.\n4 Tactful Tips to Navigate and Succeed in High School Extracurriculars\n \nDownload\n\nEver wanted to lead your own team? Make a difference in your community? Gain experience and knowledge outside of the classroom?\n\nColleges want to see that from you as well! Learning material in a classroom can only go so far in expanding your knowledge and skill set to prepare you for the world. True leadership and intrapersonal skills come from taking initiative in your high school career to delve deeper into interests outside of the curriculum. The world is diverse, with opportunities, ideas, and problems that you could help solve! We know this is daunting to explore, with so many doors that could lead you to new career paths and hobbies. When navigating what extracurriculars you could be interested in joining and how to grow and succeed within them, keep these aspects in mind:\n\nHow do you enjoy passing the time now?\n\nFinding an enjoyable extracurricular activity could stem out of your current hobbies. Imagine this: you have all of spring break free, you don’t have any homework or responsibilities. For one day, what do you want to do?\n\nFor example, maybe you thought of cooking. With an interest in cooking, you could find or create a cooking club, or take a part-time job at a small restaurant. You could even volunteer for a nonprofit that provides free meals to the community. The key part is to take your root interest then make a more meaningful impact to your community. Extracurriculars don’t always have to be academic or pre-professional, the important part is finding a space in the community for you to grow.\n\n\nWhat interest, service, performance, competition clubs do your school/ city offer? Who can you reach out to?\n\nSome schools have student councils in charge of student-led organizations. Be on the search for any club directories, club fairs, or people you can reach out to discover more about clubs at your school. If there aren’t any that interest you, look for local newspaper articles featuring nearby events or organizations that you could get involved in.  \n\n\nWhat is a weakness you wish to improve on?\n\nWhat a lot of people forget about is that extracurriculars are not just meant to develop your interests. Their underlying benefit is that they allow you to experience leadership and real-world applications for careers. Think about a weakness you have that you wish to improve on. Maybe it’s writing, public speaking, intrapersonal skills, or test taking? Think about what organizations can help you improve on these. Joining a creative writing club or your high school newspaper could help you develop your writing skills with other students. You could join the debate club or student council to work on public speaking. Consider service clubs or a service job for intrapersonal skills. Even trying out a competitive academic club like Science Olympiad could teach you some test taking skills! Joining a student organization to improve these skills not only provides a meaningful experience, but a supportive environment of students and faculty to guide you.\n\nWhat are your strengths that can support a leadership role?\n\nIt’s important to mention here that not all leadership roles require you to be a president or founder. There are many ways to increase your participation in a club or community without needing to be the face of the club. Many other critical positions that students can go for include publicists, secretaries and treasurers.\n\nTake a moment to consider skills you’re good at when completing a project. Some aspects include: one-on-one communication, writing, design, creative brainstorming. These are all great skills that can be further developed in a club and later on, a leadership position. Let’s take design for an example. Maybe you like to doodle in your free time and your creativity shines in creating the visual appearance of projects. Many clubs need posters, social media posts or brochures to help publicize. Reaching out to help or applying for a publicist position would be greatly beneficial for your interests and professional growth.\n\n\nStarting a leadership position in a club can seem daunting, but to put into perspective, many students have done it before. There are probably many peers you could talk to within your organization or even your classes that can speak on their experiences. This can help you evaluate which positions are beneficial to your time and skills, what the real workload will be and how you can handle it.\n\n\nIn the end, have fun! It may seem daunting, but the main goal in finding extracurriculars is pursuing a path that works best for you and your passions. It is possible to grow in any environment you are put in, and you will find your place eventually. High school is meant to be a time of exploration, feel free to try a little of every club your school has to offer. Or, create your own! The opportunities are endless if you set your mind to it.\n\nExtracurriculars can be a tough aspect of your high school career to navigate alone. Need extra personalized guidance? Look into 24/7’s college counseling boot camps and informational programs.\n\nThe best time to start preparing for college is right now.

Click below.\nEverything I did to Apply and Get into my dream College: Extracurriculars, SAT Prep, Recommendations\n \nDownload\n\nWhen you think about college applications, what comes to mind? Stress, pressure, anxiety? These are all very common emotions tied to college admissions. However, I’m here to help. In this post, I will share my high school journey that got me to where I am today, at my dream school and one of the top schools in the U.S., the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill!\n\nMy College Admissions Plan: \n\nAround the spring semester of my sophomore year in high school, I started seriously planning my college process. This was when I started thinking about what elements of a school I would thrive in: small/ large, urban/ suburban area.\n\nI wanted to give ample notice to people that I wanted a recommendation letter from, so that year I chose teachers I had close relationships with and provided them my list of possible colleges and interests. I made sure these were teachers I had classes or extracurriculars with for at least an entire year. Recommendation letters from adults that have known you over a long period of time allows them to write more about your character growth and interests. It is also good practice to keep contact with faculty and advisors in case they can pass on any information of opportunities to you.\n\nExtracurricular Activities: \n\nTalking to your teachers and counselors can also open doors to extracurricular activities. For my extracurriculars, I chose to stick with activities that I was passionate about and gain leadership experience through their board positions. The organization I had the strongest passion for was my high school newspaper. I joined the organization my sophomore year, and loved it so much that I became co-editor in chief my senior year. \n\nAdditionally during my sophomore year, I co-founded our school’s first Calligraphy Club. We hosted monthly events involving service, culture and collaboration with other of our school’s clubs. Calligraphy was a hobby my friends and I had picked up in middle school, but it became a platform for us to create a community and fun environment.\n\nI also joined the student council my senior year, and helped fundraise money for a local nonprofit. This experience helped me learn more about advocacy and grassroots campaigns. I also used my positions in all my extracurriculars to help create a school community working for the same goal (for example, Calligraphy Club would help create posters for the nonprofit project, the Newspaper would help publicize, and Student Council would oversee the nonprofit administration.) Becoming involved with multiple activities allowed me to work in teams of different contexts and gain hands-on leadership experience that was unique to all of my interests.\n\nIn my junior year, I worked a part-time job at a restaurant and held a summer internship position with a local non-profit. These experiences not only provided me with independence and time management skills but experience with service work and people skills. I had the privilege of holding a part-time job for disposable income rather than needing it for living income. Part-time jobs, on top of being a full-time student, can consume a great amount of time. I was fortunate enough to find a paid internship position through my guidance counselor. I highly suggest using such resources to find any interest-related positions that also financially compensate.\n\nCollege Essays:\n\nFrom all of these experiences, I grew so much in character and had many stories to share. This is what fueled my ideas for my personal statement and college essays. I had always been passionate about writing; however, these essays held true in authenticity because they were my genuine experiences and thoughts, unique to me. \n\nMany stress about college essays. However, I learned you write the best when you have genuine experiences to contemplate on. The anxiety caused by worrying over what you should write isn’t helpful. The best thing you can do is put your full focus and self into your experiences now, so inspiration on what to write comes naturally later.  I made sure to start drafting my essays my junior year and finished them that summer in order to not stress during my senior year.\n\nSAT/ACT Test Preparation: \n\nAs for the SAT, I started test prep in my junior year. I already had a strong math and reading background from taking higher-level courses throughout my middle and high school education. However, for supplemental studying, I took advantage of Khan Academy’s free online resources. Outside resources helped me understand the formatting of the standardized test, which isn’t necessarily taught in school. I practiced every week leading up to my SAT exam during the summer. I gained faster test-taking skills for the SAT by becoming comfortable with the structure and wording of the questions. I suggest studying for the SAT over the summer, then take it as soon as possible in your junior year. My school course load was lighter in the beginning of the year, which made it easier to balance both the SAT and coursework.\n\nTo conclude, the most important thing for a smooth college application process is to plan ahead and start as early as possible.

Click below.\n5 Simple Steps to Curate Your List of Colleges to Apply to\n \nDownload\n\nStarting your college application starts from deciding where you want to apply to. There are over 23,000 universities in the world, all with diverse opportunities, students, and attributes. How are you supposed to narrow down all these options? Read more of this article for five steps on deciding your list of schools to apply to!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the geographic location of where you want to study.\n\nWith options all over the world, it's easiest to narrow schools down to geographic location. An important thing to remember is that a university is not just a place to study, but a place you will live. Climate and location makes a great difference in what school you go to if you plan on living on campus. First decide what country you may want to move to, or whether you want to stay in your home country. From there, you can decide how far you are willing to move from your home town– 10, 50, 100 miles away or maybe even across the country? East or west coast?\n\nAnother element to consider is the school type: urban, rural, suburban. Urban schools are favored for its constant nightlife. Rural is favored for those that want to be near nature, or have more on-field research opportunities. Suburban is liked for being the \"middle-ground\" between the two, and is accessible by cars.\n\nOnce you decide what region you wish to study in, this will help narrow down your options.\n\n\nResearch which schools have programs you wish to study in.\n\nAre you more interested in undergraduate research opportunities, corporate internship networking, or liberal arts education? \n\nIf you have a very specific major you want to study, make sure to choose a school that offers your major, and have strong faculty and undergraduate opportunities for the field. Some universities have unique and extra competitive schools to apply within the university for the major you want. \n\nAnother tip is to contact the university's faculty and research labs. Sometimes they are willing to answer a few questions you may have on the programs offered. This is also a great way to show demonstrated interest in the school!\n\nCompare your academic standing to the school.\n\nMost schools disclose information on the typical accepted students' GPA and test scores. Universities commonly use holistic admission processes which do NOT base the entire admission decision on grades and test scores. However, gaining a general sense of accepted students' profiles will help you know whether the university's academic rigor is fit for you.\n\n\nIf possible, tour the school!\n\nAs noted in step one, geographic characteristics of the school are quite important. Touring the school in-person allows you to get a better feel of what it would be like as a student. Some schools even allow you to sit in on classes or visit the dorms. Visiting the school can substantially help narrow down schools to your list.\n\nFrom the pandemic, many schools have adopted virtual campus tours. This is an excellent option as well!\n\n\n\nCompile a list of potential schools: 1 safety, 3 target, and 2 reach.\n\nThe amount of schools you choose to apply to is up to you. Keep in mind there are constraints of application fees and time. A common myth is that applying to as many schools as possible increases your acceptance chances. Applying to a great number of schools requires you to devote much more time and energy into applications. Oftentimes the quality of each application decreases and your priorities in other areas (high school classes, extracurriculars, social life) get ignored. This is why it is important to choose carefully what type of schools to apply to. When considering, there are three types of schools differentiated by their chances of acceptance.\n\n\"Safety\" school: A \"safety\" is a school you are highly likely to get into, given your academic and demographic profile. These schools are still incredibly valuable in education, even if they are not necessarily the school you are trying your hardest to get into. Examples include in-state colleges and universities with higher general acceptance rates.\n\n\n\nTarget school: These are schools that, on average, accept students with the same academic standing as you. Make sure to also check specific majors and programs that may require an extra application process. Examples include more selective in-state colleges, out-of-state public universities, and private schools.\n\n\n\nReach school: Reach schools are typically defined as schools with comparatively lower chances of acceptance. It is still suggested you apply to a few reach schools to take you out of your comfort zone. \n\n\n\n In general, it is a good idea to apply to at least one school you are highly likely to get into (safety), more schools that match your academic standing (target), and a few schools that have slightly higher academic rigor (reach.) A suggested 1 safety : 3 targets : 2 reaches ratio is ideal as it has a nice balance of all types of schools.\n\nWith a curated and balanced list of schools to apply to, you'll be all set to a successful college application process. The key is to thoroughly research each school, and demonstrate your interest in all of them in your applications. Best of luck!\n\nWith a curated and balanced list of schools to apply to, you'll be all set to a successful college application process.

Click below.\nCollege Letters of Recommendation: What They Are and How to Receive a Great One\n \nDownload\n\nGrades and numbers aren’t everything, student character is also a key part in getting into your dream school. To learn more about applicants beyond their transcript, letters of recommendation are required by almost every university. So what are these letters, and how does one receive them?\n\nWho to Ask\n\nThese letters are written by any person (not related to you) that can speak of your character. This could be school faculty members, coaches, group leaders, etc. Most schools require a letter of recommendation from your high school’s guidance counselor. This letter tells the university about your academic standing in school. Some high school guidance counselors will ask to meet with you to better understand your character and write a letter with more substance. You can show them your resume and elaborate on your hobbies and extracurriculars.\n\nHaving an active counselor willing to reach out to you is not always the case, though. This is why keeping in contact with them and maintaining a good relationship with your counselor or high school administration is important. Be proactive during your high school career by scheduling occasional meetings, or emailing them asking about opportunities every year. \n\nIf you had rough times in school, where grades may have dropped due to unforeseen circumstances, consider sharing the situation with your guidance counselor. They may be able to write and explain your situation and defend your case as an excellent applicant in their letter. This helps your application to schools go beyond just numbers and scores, the letter of recommendation does wonders in making you as an applicant stand out.\n\nSome universities require additional letters of recommendation. Sometimes they give guidelines on who to ask. Some examples are requiring the letter to be from teachers of a certain subject, or maybe even a peer.\n\n\nFor any case, it is crucial that the letter comes from someone that can genuinely attest to your personality and growth. Generally, this would require the person to know you for a long period of time. It is suggested that you ask for a recommendation from a teacher, coach, manager etc. that you have known for at least one year. This allows them to expand more upon how they saw you grow as a student, team player, worker, etc.\n\nHow to Ask\n\nObtaining a letter of recommendation is a favor, not a right. The person writing it is doing so out of their own free time, it is critical that you respect them taking the time to do so. Because of this, give as much time in advance as possible, ask if they are willing to write one at least 3 months before the deadline.\n\nYou can also help them jumpstart the letter by providing your resume, some meaningful anecdotes you had with them, and what you learned during your relationship with them. For example, if your History teacher who you’ve had class with for two years was writing it, you can mention how a specific lesson they taught invoked your passion in social sciences.\n\n\nIt is recommended you ask in person, as this shows how important a recommendation from that specific person is to you. However, if this is not possible, you could also consider a video call. If all else fails, an email could work as well, however this depends on the person and whether they would find that impolite or not.\n\nIf there is a sense of hesitation from the person you asked, ask a different person. Someone who can immediately agree to speak upon your character will be the best person to write about you. Hesitation shows that they do not think they would write the best letter for your character, either from not knowing you well enough or not having enough commitment.\n\n\nWhat to Do After They Say Yes\n\nSend a formal recommendation request through your university application portal. Each portal differs, so make sure to research the platform before giving instructions to your recommendation writer.\n\nProvide ample resources about your job or learning experiences, and anything you would like to be mentioned in the letter. Also follow up with the person close to the deadline to make sure the letter will be submitted in time.\n\nAfterwards, thank them! You should not only thank them for writing you a letter, but for how meeting them changed you as a person for the better.\n\nWith these tips, you are bound to obtain a quality letter of recommendation in no time. \n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nWhat is a College Admission's Vision and Mission Statements and Why do You Need them\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nCrafting Your College Application - The Power of Vision, Mission, and Purpose Statements:\n\nRegarding college applications, a simple yet potent phrase that performance coaches often share with students is, \"Know your Why.\" Understanding your purpose, ambition, and direction can help distinguish your college application in the vast sea of competitive applicants. That's where the concept of vision and mission statements comes into play.\n\n1. Understanding Vision and Mission Statements\n\nLet's break down the basics.\n\nVision Statement: This outlines what you aspire to achieve in the distant future. Think of it as your \"north star.\" It's the dream, the Vision of what you see yourself accomplishing through your college education.\n\nMission Statement: While the vision statement is about the future, the mission statement is about the present moment. It's the roadmap detailing how you intend to reach that north star. Your mission statement emphasizes the path you will take to realize your Vision.\n\n2. The Significance of College Admissions\n\nBut why are these statements crucial for teens when applying to college?\n\nPersonal Branding: In a college application, you're essentially marketing yourself. Having clear vision and mission statements assists in branding yourself as an individual with purpose and drive, making you more memorable to admissions officers.\n\nFocus and Direction: College is a significant investment of time and money. Admissions officers want to know that you have thought about your future and are attending college with a purpose, not just because it's the \"next thing to do.\"\n\nConnection to the Institution: If your Vision and Mission align with the college's statements, it provides a strong case for your fit within the institution. This fit is often one of the critical factors in the admission decision.\n\n3. Crafting your Vision and Mission Statements for College Applications\n\nSo, how can teens effectively develop these essential statements?\n\nSelf-reflection: Dive deep into your aspirations. Ask yourself where you want to be in 10 or 15 years. Do you envision yourself as a groundbreaking researcher? A community leader? An entrepreneur?\n\nConcrete vs. Abstract: While having grandiose dreams is excellent, your Vision must be rooted in realism. Instead of saying, \"I want to change the world,\" try specifying, \"I aspire to develop sustainable energy solutions to combat climate change.\"\n\nConsistency: Your mission statement should align seamlessly with your Vision. If your Vision is about contributing to environmental sustainability, your Mission might involve majoring in environmental science, engaging in green campus initiatives, and interning with eco-conscious companies.\n\nFeedback: Once drafted, seek feedback. Engage teachers, counselors, or mentors in refining your statements to be more concise, authentic, and compelling.\n\nIntegration: Don't just stop at crafting the statements. Weave them into your application essays, interviews, and letters of recommendation. It adds consistency to your application narrative.\n\n4. A Guided Exercise to Start Your Journey\n\nReady to draft your vision and mission statements? Let's embark on a brief exercise.\n\nStep 1: Close your eyes and imagine your ideal life ten years from now. Where are you? What are you doing? Who's around you? Note down these visions.\n\nStep 2: Reflect on your passions and interests. List them.\n\nStep 3: Merge your Vision from step 1 with your passions from step 2. This combination will form the core of your vision statement.\n\nStep 4: Now, think about the path to get there. What courses, activities, experiences, and networks do you need in college to make this Vision a reality? That's your mission statement.\n\n5. Some Real-Life Examples\n\nTo further drive home the point, let's delve into some real-life examples:\n\nSophie's Vision: \"In a decade, I see myself as a dedicated pediatrician serving in underserved communities, ensuring that every child, irrespective of their socio-economic background, gets the medical attention they deserve.\"\n\nSophie's Mission: \"To achieve this, I aim to pursue a pre-med track with a special focus on community medicine. By volunteering at local clinics and participating in medical outreach programs, I will gain firsthand experience to prepare me for the challenges ahead.\"\n\nRohan's Vision: \"I envision creating cutting-edge tech solutions that make online learning accessible and interactive for students across the globe.\"\n\nRohan's Mission: \"To bring this to fruition, I will major in Computer Science, actively participate in college tech incubators, and collaborate with educators to understand the nuances of effective online teaching.\"\n\n6. Making Your Statements Stand Out\n\nWith countless applicants, how do you ensure your statements shine?\n\nAuthenticity: Stay true to yourself. Avoid crafting a vision or Mission based on what admissions officers want to hear. Authenticity resonates far more than fabricated ambitions.\n\nBe Specific: General statements can get lost in the mix. Instead of saying, \"I want to make a difference,\" articulate how you want to do it.\n\nShow Growth: Use your statements to highlight your evolution. Perhaps a past experience shaped your Vision; sharing that journey can offer a unique insight into your growth and determination.\n\n7. Evolving With Your Statements\n\nRemember, as you grow and encounter new experiences, your Vision and Mission may evolve. And that's okay. College is as much about discovering yourself as it is about academics. While your Vision and Mission guide your path, stay open to the myriad opportunities that might reshape or refine your journey.\n\n8. Final Thoughts\n\nThe world of college admissions can often feel overwhelming. But amid the chaos, your vision and mission statements act as a compass, offering direction and clarity. They help articulate your aspirations and anchor you to your goals, making the journey, no matter how winding, purposeful, and enriching.\n\nRemember, every big dream starts with a vision. By defining yours and laying out a mission to achieve it, you're not just paving a path to college admission but also setting the foundation for a future built on purpose and passion. So, dream big, plan well, and let your Vision and Mission be your guiding stars.\n\n9. The Role of a Purpose Statement\n\nWhile vision and mission statements have been our primary focus, there's another equally significant statement worth discussing: the Purpose Statement. This statement clarifies why you want to pursue a particular path. It's the heartbeat of your aspirations, tying together the 'what' from your Vision and the 'how' from your Mission.\n\nUnderstanding your purpose is like having an internal compass—your intrinsic motivation, the burning passion or reason that drives your Vision and dictates your Mission.\n\nCrafting a Purpose Statement:\n\nEmotion and Rationale: Dive into the emotions behind your goals. Ask yourself, \"Why does my vision matter to me?\" and \"Why am I passionate about this mission?\" By exploring these feelings, you delve into the core of your purpose.\n\nShort and Powerful: Your purpose statement should be concise yet impactful. It should resonate emotionally, making it memorable.\n\nRooted in the Present: While your Vision might be a future aspiration, and your Mission the roadmap to get there, your purpose is grounded in the present. It's your current motivation and reason for striving.\n\nExample: If we revisit Sophie's ambition to be a pediatrician serving underserved communities, her purpose statement might be: \"Every child deserves a healthy start, regardless of their background. I've witnessed health disparities in my community and am driven to bridge that gap.\"\n\nIncorporating a purpose statement provides depth to your narrative, offering college admissions a three-dimensional view of your aspirations: the 'what' (Vision), the 'how' (Mission), and most crucially, the 'why' (purpose). These statements paint a comprehensive picture of your ambitions, motivations, and determination.\n\nConclusion: Charting a Course with Clarity and Conviction\n\nNavigating the vast sea of college admissions can sometimes feel like traversing uncharted waters. Yet, with a clear vision, Mission, and purpose, the journey becomes less daunting and more purposeful. These statements aren't mere words on paper but profound reflections of who you are and where you aspire to go. They provide a beacon of clarity in an often overwhelming process, ensuring you stand out in the admission process and embark on a college journey aligned with your deepest ambitions and motivations. Remember, while college is a significant milestone, the passion, purpose, and clarity of intent will shape your voyage and the mark you leave on the world. So, as you pen down your applications, let these statements be your guiding stars, illuminating your path with purpose and promise.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQs in the comment section below:\n\nHow have your experiences shaped your vision, mission, and purpose for your future, and how do they align with the ethos of your desired college or university?\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

But what is success, and how does one achieve it? Success isn't just about the end goal; it's about the journey, the roadmap, and the mile markers along the way. In high school academics, setting performance goals like targeting a specific GPA or strategically selecting courses is crucial. Let's explore why these elements are pivotal and how they can reshape a student's high school journey and beyond.\n\n1. Clarity of Vision: Performance goals serve as a compass, providing direction. Just as a traveler wouldn't set out without a destination, students shouldn't progress through high school without clear academic targets. Aiming for a specific GPA, for instance, gives students a tangible number to chase. This numerical goal offers clarity, helping students understand where they stand and what they need to achieve.\n\n2. Prioritizing Efforts\n\nWhen students establish concrete goals like maintaining a 3.7 GPA or enrolling in three AP courses by senior year, they inherently prioritize their efforts. They know where to dedicate more time, which subjects demand extra attention, and when to seek help. Without such goals, students can easily be overwhelmed, not knowing which academic challenges to address first.\n\n3. Building a Competitive Edge\n\nThe college admissions landscape is fiercely competitive. Universities look for students who excel academically and demonstrate consistency and an upward trajectory in their performance. Students can present a compelling commitment, drive, and growth narrative by setting and achieving specific performance goals throughout high school.\n\n4. Developing Resilience\n\nNot all goals are easily achieved. Sometimes, a student might fall short of their targeted GPA or struggle in a chosen advanced course. However, these challenges provide valuable life lessons. They teach resilience, determination, and the importance of adaptability. Learning to navigate academic challenges in high school equips students with the tenacity required in college and later life.\n\n5. Informed Course Selection\n\nHigh school offers many courses, from foundational subjects to specialized electives. Goal-setting encourages students to be proactive and strategic in their course selection. For instance, if a student aspires to study engineering in college, they might prioritize advanced courses in math and science. Such informed decisions ensure that students are adequately prepared for their future academic endeavors.\n\n6. Encouraging Time Management & Organizational Skills\n\nWith a clear GPA goal in mind or a set list of courses to conquer, students quickly realize the importance of time management. They learn to juggle assignments, balance extracurriculars, and allocate study hours effectively. These skills are vital for high school and indispensable in college and the professional world.\n\n7. Boosting Self-Esteem and Confidence\n\nAchieving set performance goals provides a sense of accomplishment. Every 'A' on a report card or successful completion of a challenging course reinforces a student's belief in their abilities. This boost in self-esteem and confidence is invaluable, pushing students to set even higher benchmarks for themselves and pursue them zealously.\n\n8. Enhancing Focus and Minimizing Distractions\n\nIn today's digital age, distractions are everywhere. However, with clear performance goals, students are more likely to stay focused. They can better resist the pull of social media, video games, or other diversions, understanding the bigger picture and the academic milestones they've set for themselves.\n\n9. Creating Accountability\n\nGoals, especially when shared with mentors, teachers, or parents, create a sense of accountability. Knowing that others know their objectives and are rooting for their success can motivate students to stay on track. This external accountability can be the nudge some students must consistently put in their best effort.\n\n10. Shaping a Brighter Future\n\nUltimately, the performance goals set in high school have a ripple effect, shaping students' futures. Whether it's gaining admission to a dream college, securing scholarships, or laying the groundwork for a successful career, these high school milestones play a pivotal role.\n\nMapping the Blueprint for Academic Success:\n\nWhen I sit across from bright-eyed high schoolers, a question often emerges: “Where do I begin?” Setting performance goals can feel daunting. However, it's more than just aiming for academic laurels. It's about creating a blueprint for success—a roadmap that ensures academic achievements and nurtures personal growth.\n\n11. Fostering Lifelong Learning Habits\n\nSetting performance goals, like targeting a particular GPA or choosing specific classes, instills a love for learning. When students see tangible results from their efforts, they associate hard work with success. This connection fosters a lifelong passion for knowledge and growth. They don't just learn for grades; they learn for the joy of discovery.\n\n12. Cultivating Critical Thinking Skills\n\nStrategically selecting courses encourages students to think critically about their future. If a student aims to major in literature, they might opt for advanced English classes or join a debate club to hone their argumentative skills. Such decisions compel students to analyze their strengths, passions, and future aspirations, sharpening their critical thinking faculties in the process.\n\n13. Embracing a Holistic Approach\n\nA well-rounded education isn't just about core subjects. It's about exploring various disciplines and broadening horizons. By setting performance goals related to course selection, students might venture into fields they hadn't previously considered, such as art, music, or even coding. This holistic approach ensures a diversified skill set and a richer educational experience.\n\n14. Facilitating Constructive Feedback\n\nPerformance goals also pave the way for constructive feedback. When students and teachers are aligned on academic objectives, educators can provide tailored guidance to help pupils reach (and surpass) those benchmarks. This continuous feedback loop, rooted in defined goals, results in more targeted and effective learning strategies.\n\n15. Preparing for College Rigor\n\nThe leap from high school to college can be immense. However, students who've set and worked towards performance goals are better equipped to handle the rigor of tertiary education. They've already honed their study habits, developed resilience, and learned to manage their time—all essential skills for navigating the demanding landscape of college.\n\n16. Enabling Career Readiness\n\nThe decisions made in high school often ripple into professional lives. Students who’ve meticulously chosen courses aligned with their career aspirations have a leg up when entering the job market. They not only have the necessary academic knowledge but also possess a clear understanding of their professional trajectory.\n\n17. Encouraging Peer Collaboration\n\nPerformance goals also foster an environment of collaborative learning. Students with similar academic objectives often form study groups, discuss challenges, and share resources. This collaborative spirit not only aids in academic success but also teaches teamwork, a vital skill in almost every professional field.\n\n18. Personal Growth and Self-Reflection\n\nFinally, the journey towards achieving performance goals is also one of self-discovery. Students learn about their strengths, confront their weaknesses, and understand their passions. This period of introspection is invaluable, shaping their identities and guiding their future choices.\n\nIn Summation:\n\nNavigating the turbulent waters of high school can feel overwhelming for many. Yet, the process becomes more manageable, purposeful, and rewarding when students anchor themselves with well-defined performance goals. These goals aren’t merely academic targets; they are the pillars that support holistic growth, future readiness, and the blossoming of one's true potential. By consciously setting and working towards these benchmarks, students prepare themselves for academic excellence and a fulfilling life ahead.\n\nWhen you reflect on your high school journey or the path you wish for a young individual, remember the profound impact of goal-setting. Performance goals are more than mere milestones; they act as lighthouses, guiding students toward their desired destination while helping them avoid the pitfalls and storms that can derail their journey.\n\nThe magic truly lies in the deliberate act of setting these goals and diligently pursuing them. The discipline, resilience, and insights gained along the way are invaluable life skills that will stand students in good stead, no matter where their journey takes them next.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQs in the comment section below:\n\nReflecting on the significance of setting performance goals, what has been your personal experience or observation?

Click below.\nUnderstanding the PSAT and Why it is Important - A Comprehensive Guide\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nUnderstanding the PSAT: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nThe Preliminary SAT (PSAT), or the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT), is a standardized test often taken by high school sophomores and juniors in the United States. While some view it as merely a practice test for the SAT, the PSAT serves several critical functions that can impact your college journey and beyond. So, let's tackle many students' and parents' questions about this test.\n\nWhat is the PSAT, and Should You Take It?\n\nThe PSAT is a standardized test that assesses your Math, Reading, and Writing skills. It is a shortened version of the SAT and usually serves as a preliminary step for students who intend to take the SAT later. But should you take it?\n\nThe answer is, generally, yes. The PSAT is an excellent diagnostic tool to evaluate your academic strengths and weaknesses before the SAT. Moreover, it determines eligibility for the National Merit Scholarship, which can lead to substantial financial aid.\n\nIf you're a first- or second-year high school student considering the PSAT, you might want to consult 24/7 Teach's Freshman and Sophomore College Counseling for expert advice tailored to your needs.\n\nHow Does the PSAT Affect College Acceptance and Scholarships?\n\nWhile the PSAT is not used for college admissions, the skills you gain and the scores you achieve can influence your SAT performance, a crucial element in your college application. Additionally, doing well on the PSAT can make you eligible for the National Merit Scholarship, a prestigious award many colleges value. This scholarship can offset tuition costs and make your application stand out in a competitive field.\n\nTo further enhance your test-taking skills, consider enrolling in 24/7 Teach's Test Prep Services, which can offer a comprehensive roadmap for PSAT success.\n\nHow Long Should You Study for the PSAT?\n\nThe amount of time you should dedicate to PSAT preparation depends on your existing academic skills and the goals you hope to achieve. A general recommendation is to begin at least three to six months before the test date. Consistent practice can help you identify weaknesses, improve your skills, and build confidence.\n\nIn Which Grade Should You Start Studying for the PSAT?\n\nThough high school sophomores and juniors often take the PSAT, there's no harm in starting your preparation even earlier. First-year students with a solid academic foundation can begin familiarizing themselves with the test format and types of questions. This early start can give you an advantage, providing more time to improve and adapt your strategies.\n\nIs the PSAT Very Hard?\n\nThe PSAT's difficulty level is relative to your preparedness and prior academic background. It is designed to test skills you should have acquired by your sophomore or junior year in high school. While you may find some sections more challenging than others, remember that the PSAT is, at its core, a practice test. Its primary purpose is to help you gauge where you stand academically.\n\nIs an 800 PSAT Score Good?\n\nThe highest possible score on the PSAT is 1520, so an 800 would be below the median. While it's not an awful score, it indicates room for improvement, especially if you aim for competitive colleges or scholarships. Use the score as constructive feedback to guide your future preparation.\n\nIn conclusion, the PSAT is a vital tool in your academic arsenal. It serves not only as practice for the SAT but also as a gateway to potential scholarships and a gauge of your academic skills. You can make the most of this opportunity with thoughtful preparation, including utilizing resources like 24/7 Teach's Freshman and Sophomore College Counseling and Test Prep Services.\n\nEffective Strategies for PSAT Preparation\n\nStudying for the PSAT effectively is about more than just cramming information. It's about understanding your strengths and weaknesses and employing strategies that are tailored to you. Here are some tips for adequate PSAT preparation:\n\nStart Early\n\nIt's generally recommended that students begin their preparation at least three to six months before the PSAT. However, there's no downside to starting earlier, especially if you're aiming for a National Merit Scholarship or want to maximize your SAT score later on.\n\nDiagnostic Tests\n\nOne of the best ways to understand your current academic standing is to take a diagnostic test. Many test prep services offer these, but you can also find free versions online. Use the results to identify the areas where you need the most improvement.\n\nCustomized Study Plan\n\nOnce you've identified your weaknesses, create a study plan that addresses them. This plan can include a mix of self-study, guided tutorials, and mock tests. Consider using 24/7 Teach's Test Prep Services for a comprehensive, structured approach to your preparation.\n\nConsistent Practice\n\nConsistency is key when preparing for the PSAT. Studying for an hour each day is better than cramming eight hours in a single session. Consistent study habits help you retain information and skills more effectively.\n\nTime Management\n\nDuring the test, each minute is precious. Practice answering questions under timed conditions to get a feel for the pace of the test. Learning how to manage your time during the PSAT can also translate into better time management skills for the SAT and your academic life.\n\nTake Mock Tests\n\nRegularly taking full-length practice tests helps you gauge your progress, adapt your strategies, and get accustomed to the test's format. Review your answers critically to understand not just what you got wrong but why you got it wrong.\n\nSeek Professional Guidance\n\nWhile self-study is essential, sometimes you need an expert's touch to guide you. 24/7 Teach's Test Prep Services can provide personalized coaching that aligns with your academic needs and goals.\n\nThe Game-Changing Power of the PSAT: A Personal Experience\n\nMy PSAT experience forever changed my life. Taking the test in my sophomore year of high school, I scored exceptionally well, making me eligible for the National Merit Scholarship. My diligent preparation paid off not just in a high score but in the form of a full scholarship to my dream college, which I was awarded in my junior year. This scholarship has enabled me to pursue my academic dreams without the burden of financial stress and has given me a sense of achievement and confidence that continues to shape my life.\n\nIn conclusion, the PSAT is not just a practice test; it's an opportunity. With the right resources and strategic preparation, such as those offered by 24/7 Teach, you can unlock doors to scholarships, college acceptances, and a bright future. So start preparing now, and who knows? You might find yourself with a life-changing scholarship, like I did.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nWhat unique strategies have you employed in your PSAT preparation, and how have they impacted your academic journey so far?\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

With college applications come the daunting yet exciting task of writing a college admissions essay. The essay plays a pivotal role in giving admissions officers an insight into who you are beyond just test scores and GPA. So, how do you make your essay stand out? This comprehensive guide introduces you to the four key pillars of writing an impressive college essay: Authenticity, Vulnerability, Impactfulness, and Uniqueness, or the \"So-What Rule.\"\n\nIf you're looking to further refine your essay and other aspects of your college application, consider 24/7 Teach's College Admissions Coaching services and our College Essay Writing Bootcamp. Want proof that our approach works? Read this blog post by one of our recent bootcamp graduates, who secured a full scholarship to an Ivy League school.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nWhat is Authenticity, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nOne of the most common questions students ask is, \"How do I write a good college admissions essay?\" The answer starts with Authenticity. Authenticity means presenting your true self in your writing. Admissions officers read thousands of essays every year; they can easily spot a fake. Your essay is your chance to show who you are, not who you think colleges want you to be.\n\nWhat Do Colleges Want to See in an Admissions Essay?\n\nAuthenticity is high on the list. College admissions officers look for essays that provide a clear and genuine picture of the applicant. They appreciate honesty and can often tell when a student is being insincere or exaggerating. Authentic essays come from self-reflection and an in-depth understanding of oneself, which is why it’s crucial to consider your life experiences, values, and passions before putting pen to paper.\n\nHow to Showcase Authenticity\n\nBe Honest: Don't embellish your achievements or create a narrative that isn't true to who you are.\n\nShare Your Values: Explain what matters to you and why.\n\nAvoid Clichés: Colleges receive countless essays about “life-changing” volunteer trips and the “eye-opening” experience of leading a sports team to victory. Make sure your topic truly reflects your interests and experiences.\n\nVulnerability\n\nThe Power of Vulnerability\n\nBeing vulnerable in your essay means sharing aspects of yourself that you may not usually discuss openly. These could be challenges you've faced, mistakes you've made, or even weaknesses you've identified and are working on. Vulnerability provides a window into your ability to overcome challenges and grow from them.\n\nHow to Infuse Vulnerability in Your Essay\n\nDiscuss Challenges: Without dwelling on the negative, discuss the challenges you've faced and what you've learned from them.\n\nReflect on Growth: How did the experience change you? What did you learn?\n\nBe Self-Aware: Demonstrating that you are reflective and self-aware shows maturity and the ability to adapt to new situations, a quality colleges value.\n\nImpactfulness\n\nWhat Does it Mean to be Impactful?\n\nBeing impactful means that your essay leaves a lasting impression on the reader. An impactful essay shows why you would be an asset to the college community and how you plan to contribute in the future.\n\nHow to Write an Impactful Essay\n\nBe Specific: Provide concrete examples of your achievements and how you've made a positive impact.\n\nDiscuss Future Goals: Briefly outline your future ambitions and how you plan to achieve them, particularly how you intend to contribute to the college community and beyond.\n\nMake it Relevant: Relate your essay back to why you would be a good fit for the particular college and its programs.\n\nUniqueness and the So-What Rule\n\nWhy Uniqueness Matters\n\nIn the sea of qualified candidates, your uniqueness is your biggest asset. This doesn’t mean you have to have a unique life story; instead, it means you have a unique perspective on common experiences.\n\nHow to Make Your Essay Unique\n\nFind Your Angle: Think about how your viewpoint or experiences make you different.\n\nVoice and Tone: Your writing style can be a tool for showcasing your uniqueness. Just ensure it remains appropriate for an academic essay.\n\nThe So-What Rule\n\nThis brings us to the “So-What Rule.” Your essay should make the reader stop and think, “So what? Why should I care about this?” If you’re writing about a common topic like “overcoming failure,” what is it about your experience that makes it worth reading?\n\nMastering the art of the college essay can seem like a daunting task, but by focusing on the four key pillars—Authenticity, Vulnerability, Impactfulness, and Uniqueness—you can craft a compelling narrative that stands out. Let's dive deeper.\n\nAuthenticity (Continued)\n\nActionable Tips for Authenticity\n\nA. Self-Reflection Exercises: Before you begin writing, take some time to jot down moments in your life that have shaped who you are. This exercise can help you identify the real 'you' that you want to present in your essay.\n\nB. Seek Feedback but Stay True: While it's useful to get feedback on your essay, ensure that the final version is still authentically 'you.'\n\nReal-World Example of Authenticity\n\nImagine you're an aspiring environmental science major. Instead of writing a generic essay about your love for nature, focus on the specific moment you realized you wanted to dedicate yourself to environmental issues. Maybe it was when you started a recycling program at your school, or perhaps it was the influence of a particular book or person. The more personal and genuine your essay, the more it will stand out.\n\nVulnerability (Continued)\n\nActionable Tips for Vulnerability\n\nA. The \"Three Whys\" Technique: For every challenge or failure you discuss, ask yourself 'why' three times to get to the root cause and your emotional response to it.\n\nB. Balanced Perspective: Vulnerability does not mean weakness. Show how your vulnerabilities have led to strengths or growth.\n\nReal-World Example of Vulnerability\n\nSuppose you struggled in your freshman year academically but showed steady improvement over the years. Don't shy away from discussing this. Instead, you could write about how this struggle helped you develop resilience and better study habits.\n\nImpactfulness (Continued)\n\nActionable Tips for Impactfulness\n\nA. Use Data: If possible, include quantifiable impacts of your actions, like “Raised $5,000 for a local animal shelter” or “Tutored 15 students in underprivileged communities.”\n\nB. Show, Don't Tell: Instead of saying you’re passionate about community service, provide examples of your volunteer work and describe how these experiences had a lasting impact on you and your community.\n\nReal-World Example of Impactfulness\n\nMaybe you have a passion for social justice and started a blog to raise awareness about various issues. Describe how this blog attracted thousands of readers and led to community action or changed perspectives.\n\nUniqueness and the So-What Rule (Continued)\n\nActionable Tips for Uniqueness\n\nA. The 'So What?' Test: Once you've written your essay, read it and ask yourself, \"So what?\". If your essay doesn't answer this question, go back to the drawing board.\n\nB. Unusual Hobbies or Skills: Sometimes, uniqueness can be highlighted through uncommon hobbies or skills you possess that could make you a more interesting addition to the college community.\n\nReal-World Example of Uniqueness\n\nLet's say you are an expert at beekeeping and have won several awards for honey production. That's an unusual and interesting skill that could make for a fascinating essay and contribute to your uniqueness.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCrafting a compelling college essay is a process that demands time, introspection, and multiple drafts. Keep the four pillars—Authenticity, Vulnerability, Impactfulness, and Uniqueness—in mind, and you'll be well on your way to writing an essay that is both meaningful and memorable.\n\nIf you’re still feeling a bit overwhelmed, don't hesitate to check out 24/7 Teach's expert College Admissions Coaching services and our College Essay Writing Bootcamp.\n\nRemember, the journey of writing a college essay is also one of self-discovery.

Monica Matthews, a dedicated mother of three, discovered the immense potential of scholarships when her eldest son successfully secured over $100,000 for his college education. Inspired by her journey, Monica authored the invaluable e-book, \"How to Win College Scholarships,\" to share her wisdom with other aspiring students and their families. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve deep into the world of scholarships, offering expert advice and strategies on finding scholarships for U.S. and international students, ensuring that your dream of attending college becomes a financial reality.\n\nUnderstanding the Difference Between Grants and Scholarships: Before we embark on the scholarship quest, we must grasp the fundamental distinction between grants and scholarships. While both are considered \"gift aid\" and do not require repayment, they serve different purposes:\n\nGrants: Typically awarded based on financial need, grants, such as the federal Pell Grant, aim to support low-income students. Need-based grants can originate from federal, state, or college sources.\n\nScholarships: These awards are typically based on merit, including academic excellence, athletic achievements, or specific talents. While some scholarships do consider financial need, they primarily recognize and reward exceptional performance.\n\nHow to Find Scholarships for College: Initiating your scholarship journey requires a structured approach to identifying suitable opportunities. Here's a comprehensive roadmap on where and how to search for scholarships:\n\nLocal Scholarships: Begin your search with local scholarships, which are often less competitive. Many community organizations, local businesses, and foundations offer scholarships tailored to students within your geographical area.\n\nNational Scholarship Databases: Local scholarships are valuable, but don't underestimate national opportunities. Register on scholarship database websites such as Fastweb.com, Cappex.com, Unigo.com, and U.S. News Scholarship Finder. These platforms provide access to various scholarships, ranging from modest awards to substantial financial aid packages.\n\nNew Scholarship Databases: Stay ahead of the curve by utilizing emerging scholarship databases that permit students to commence their research as early as their freshman year. Keeping your student profile updated ensures you're well-prepared when the time comes to apply.\n\nDedicated Scholarship Email Account: To streamline your scholarship applications and manage correspondence efficiently, create a dedicated email account specifically for scholarship-related communication. This practice will help you maintain organization and reduce clutter in your primary inbox.\n\nComplete the FAFSA: Even if you believe you won't qualify for need-based aid, completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is crucial. Some scholarship applications require a submitted FAFSA for eligibility, making it a vital step in the process.\n\nScholarships for College Students: Scholarships are not exclusively reserved for high school seniors. College students can continue their scholarship search while pursuing their degrees. Here are some valuable sources:\n\nSchool Resources: Your institution's financial aid office and academic department are valuable resources for finding scholarships tailored to current students. They often maintain lists of opportunities within your field of study.\n\nProfessional Societies: Many professional organizations offer scholarships to college students majoring in relevant fields. These scholarships are designed to promote the industry and support promising individuals. Don't hesitate to explore these opportunities within your chosen discipline.\n\nExploring the Diversity of Scholarships: Scholarships come in various forms, and it's a common misconception that they are exclusively for top-tier students. Here are some diverse scholarship categories to consider:\n\nCommunity Service Scholarships: If you are passionate about giving back to your community through activities such as volunteering, local clean-up efforts, or fundraising for nonprofits, scholarships are available to acknowledge your dedication.\n\nFirst-Generation Scholarships: Numerous scholarships are specifically designed for first-generation college students, individuals who are the first in their families to pursue higher education. Programs like QuestBridge's National College Match offer opportunities for high-achieving, first-generation students from low-income backgrounds.\n\nUnderrepresented Groups: Scholarships are available for students from underrepresented backgrounds, including African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander American, or Hispanic American students. The Gates Scholarship, for instance, offers opportunities to students who meet specific criteria, including being in the top 10% of their high school class.\n\nUnique Scholarships: Beyond academic and athletic achievements, scholarships are available for individuals with unique characteristics and interests. These could include scholarships for tall individuals, left-handed students, or those with a passion for niche hobbies like skateboarding. Exploring these unconventional opportunities can lead to unexpected financial support.\n\nWhen to Start Applying for Scholarships: The scholarship application process is not a last-minute endeavor; it requires careful planning and persistence. To maximize your chances of securing scholarship money, consider the following:\n\nStart Early: Begin your scholarship search as early as possible. The earlier you start, the more opportunities you'll uncover.\n\nHigh School Seniors: For high school seniors, the fall is an ideal time to commence your scholarship applications. Many application deadlines are set around March 1, so initiating the process early is crucial.\n\nOngoing Effort: Understand that the scholarship application process is not confined to a few months. Maintain your dedication and continue searching and applying throughout your academic journey. Scholarships are available at various stages of your educational path.\n\nConclusion: Securing college scholarships is a transformative endeavor that can significantly reduce the financial burden of higher education for both U.S. and international students. By comprehending the distinction between grants and scholarships, harnessing the power of national and local databases, maintaining organizational practices like a dedicated scholarship email account, and exploring diverse scholarship opportunities, you can pave the way to achieving your educational dreams.\n\nRemember, your scholarship journey starts early, continues throughout your academic career, and encompasses many opportunities. With determination, persistence, and the guidance provided in this comprehensive guide, you can position yourself to succeed in securing the financial aid necessary to make your college aspirations a reality. Scholarships are not reserved for the few; they are accessible to those who seek them diligently. So, confidently embark on your scholarship quest and watch the doors to higher education swing open before you, ushering in a brighter future without the heavy burden of student debt.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQs in the comment section below:\n\nIn your opinion, what are some innovative or unconventional approaches that students can take to stand out when applying for scholarships? \n\nHow can they showcase their unique qualities and experiences to increase their chances of securing scholarship awards?\"\n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nThe College Admissions Process: A Step-by-Step Journey to Your Dream School\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nA Step-by-Step Journey to Your Dream College:\n\nEmbarking on the journey to college can be as exhilarating as it is daunting. The path to higher education is paved with crucial steps and milestones, each pivotal in unlocking the gates to your dream school. Understanding this process is essential, and with the expert guidance from 24/7 Teach's College Admissions Coaching services, your path can become significantly clearer.\n\nPreparing in Advance: Laying the Groundwork for Success\n\nResearching Schools: A Match Made in Academia\n\nYour college experience hinges on finding the right school that aligns with your academic ambitions, social preferences, and financial circumstances. Delve deep into college websites, visit campuses if possible, and engage with admissions officers. Remember, you're not just choosing a school – you're choosing a home for the next four years.\n\nChoosing a Major: The Compass for Your Academic Journey\n\nAlthough declaring a major isn't always necessary during the application phase, knowing your academic direction can inform your course selections, extracurricular activities, and even which schools you apply to. Use tools and quizzes to explore fields of study that excite you and align with your career aspirations.\n\nStandardized Tests: Your Academic Passport\n\nThe SAT or ACT scores remain a rite of passage for many colleges. Preparing for these exams can't be overstressed. Start early with practice tests, enroll in prep courses, and consider professional coaching. Excellence here can open doors to scholarships and prestigious programs.\n\nThe Initial Leap: Starting Your College Application\n\nApplication Forms: The Foundation\n\nThe first step in actualizing your college dreams is filling out application forms. Platforms like the Common App streamline this process, allowing you to apply to multiple colleges with one uniform application. This is where you compile your personal information, academic records, and more. Precision and attention to detail here are non-negotiable.\n\nThe Ten Commandments of College Admissions\n\nThou Shalt Research Thoroughly: Begin with understanding each college's ethos, programs, and requirements.\n\nThou Shalt Organize Documents: Keep your academic records, standardized test scores, and identification documents in order.\n\nThou Shalt Cultivate Recommenders: Choose mentors who know you well to write your letters of recommendation. Give them ample time and the necessary background information to craft compelling endorsements.\n\nThou Shalt Draft Compelling Essays: Your college essay is your voice in the admissions process. Make it resonate. 24/7 Teach's College Essay Writing Bootcamp can help you hone this critical skill.\n\nThou Shalt Showcase Thyself: Develop a robust resume and portfolio to display your talents, achievements, and extracurricular involvement.\n\nThou Shalt Seek Financial Aid: Navigate the labyrinth of financial aid with Unlocking Financial Aid - A Comprehensive Guide to Filling Out the FAFSA and Accessing Scholarships.\n\nThou Shalt Practice Interview Skills: If your colleges offer or require interviews, prepare to present yourself as confidently on camera or in-person as you do on paper.\n\nThou Shalt Stay Organized: Track deadlines, follow up on submissions, and check application statuses diligently.\n\nThou Shalt Embrace Patience and Persistence: The application process is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay the course with resilience.\n\nThou Shalt Not Be Deterred by Setbacks: Whether it's a waitlist notice or a need for additional information, respond with promptness and positivity.\n\nOrder in the Application Review Process: The Admissions Office Workflow\n\nUnderstanding how colleges review applications can demystify what happens after you hit 'submit.' While the exact order may vary, the process typically involves an initial check of your application's completeness, followed by a more detailed review where admissions officers consider your academic performance, test scores, essays, extracurricular activities, and recommendations. If your application passes these rounds, it often goes to a committee for final decisions.\n\nFinancing Your Future: The Quest for Financial Aid\n\nNavigating the Financial Aid Labyrinth\n\nCollege can be an expensive venture, but don't let the sticker shock deter you. It's crucial to explore all avenues of financial assistance to alleviate the burden of college expenses. Begin by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is your gateway to grants, loans, and work-study funds. Supplement this by seeking scholarships; they're not just for valedictorians and athletes. Scholarships can be based on community service, personal interests, intended majors, and unique characteristics. Tap into 24/7 Teach's Ultimate Guide to Finding College Scholarships for a comprehensive approach to securing scholarships.\n\nApplication Fees and Waivers: Every Penny Counts\n\nApplication fees can add up quickly when you're applying to multiple colleges. However, fee waivers are available for students who qualify. Don't hesitate to reach out to your school counselor or directly to the college's admissions office to inquire about fee waivers. This simple step can save you money and ensure that application costs do not stand in the way of your college dreams.\n\nThe Power of the Pen: Crafting Your College Essay\n\nFinding Your Unique Voice\n\nThe college essay is one of the most critical components of your application. It's the soul within the stack of papers that defines who you are. It's your chance to tell a story only you can tell. Start by brainstorming ideas that are meaningful to you. Reflect on your experiences, challenges, passions, and dreams. For inspiration and guidance, explore the College Essay Writing Bootcamp offered by 24/7 Teach, which can provide you with the tools and feedback necessary to create a memorable and impactful essay.\n\nRevisions: The Path to Perfection\n\nDon't expect to get it right on the first try. Good writing is re-writing. Draft your essay, and then let it rest. Return to it with fresh eyes to revise and refine. Seek feedback from teachers, peers, and family. Their insights can help you polish your essay until it shines.\n\nExtracurriculars: More Than Just a Pastime\n\nThe Weight of Extracurriculars\n\nIn the admissions process, extracurricular activities showcase your interests and commitments outside the classroom. They tell colleges a lot about your character and passions. Dive into activities that align with your intended field of study or display leadership, initiative, and a willingness to engage with your community. To understand the impact of these activities, consider reading about how extracurriculars and sports can affect college admissions in the Power of Extracurriculars and Sports in College Admissions blog post.\n\nAfter the Application: The Waiting Game and Beyond\n\nPost-Submission: Staying Proactive\n\nOnce you've submitted your applications, your work isn't entirely done. Stay proactive by confirming that all parts of your application have been received and are complete. This includes test scores, letters of recommendation, transcripts, and supplemental materials. Keep an eye on your email and application portals for updates or requests for additional information.\n\nInterviews: The Human Touch\n\nIf an interview is offered, take advantage of this opportunity to make a personal impression. Prepare by reviewing potential questions, conducting mock interviews, and researching the school's culture and values. Be yourself – authenticity is key.\n\nThe Final Decision: Acceptance and Commitment\n\nWhen acceptance letters arrive, it's time to make your final decision. Consider all factors: academic programs, financial aid packages, campus culture, and location. Once you've made your choice, submit your deposit to secure your spot.\n\n\nMaximizing High School Experience: The Launchpad for Success\n\nLeveraging High School Years\n\nHigh school is more than just a prelude to college; it's a critical time for growth and exploration. It's the phase where you develop not just academically but also personally and socially. Engage in diverse classes to explore your interests, which may lead to a potential major or career path. Taking advanced courses or dual-enrollment classes can not only challenge you but also showcase your readiness for college-level work. Additionally, involvement in clubs, student government, or volunteer work can develop skills and relationships that last beyond high school.\n\nBuilding a Comprehensive Profile\n\nA well-rounded student is not just one with good grades but one with a narrative. Your activities, achievements, part-time jobs, and personal projects build your story. They reflect your commitment, resilience, and ability to balance multiple responsibilities. Document these experiences as they form the chapters of your high school journey, and highlight them in your applications to give admission officers insight into your character.\n\nIf You are Waitlisted: Staying Hopeful and Proactive\n\nUnderstanding the Waitlist\n\nThe waitlist is not a denial; it's a \"not yet.\" If you are waitlisted, understand what that means for the specific college. Some schools rank their waitlisted candidates, while others do not. It's vital to express your continued interest by following the school's preferred process, which may include sending a letter of intent, updated grades, or additional letters of recommendation.\n\nStrategic Waitlist Actions\n\nWhile waiting, don't put your future on hold. Continue to explore other options and secure a spot at another institution. This ensures you have a place to go if the waitlist doesn't turn in your favor. But if it does, be ready to act quickly since waitlist offers can come at any time and often require a swift decision.\n\nPreparing for the First Year of College: A New Chapter\n\nTransitioning to College Life\n\nTransitioning from high school to college can be daunting, but it's also an exciting opportunity for growth and independence. To prepare, engage with any summer reading or prep work your college provides. Reach out to future classmates, perhaps through social media groups, to start building your community.\n\nOrientation and Beyond\n\nTake full advantage of orientation programs to get acclimated to your new environment. These programs are designed to answer questions, ease concerns, and provide a roadmap for your first year. Registering for classes is just one piece of the puzzle; also consider how you'll manage your time, which clubs you'll join, and how you'll maintain a balanced college life.\n\nStaying Grounded and Focused\n\nAs you embark on your college journey, stay grounded. Remember your goals and the steps you've taken to get here. College is a time of exploration, learning, and challenge. Embrace it with an open mind and a willingness to adapt. Maintain a strong support network—family, friends, mentors—and don't hesitate to utilize campus resources like counseling centers, tutoring services, and career advising.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nAs you reflect on the step-by-step journey outlined in the blog post, which aspect of the college admissions process do you find most challenging or exciting?

Click below.\nWhat are Core Values, and How to Identify and Develop Yours\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nThe distinctions beyond academic content between a college essay and a school essay:\n\nA college essay, often referred to as a personal statement or admissions essay, is a unique and crucial component of a college application. It is a written document that allows applicants to introduce themselves, showcase their personality, and convey their individuality to college admissions committees. College essays serve as a way for admissions officers to gain deeper insights into the applicant beyond what can be discerned from grades, test scores, and other application materials. These essays are typically required as part of the application process for undergraduate programs at colleges and universities.\n\nHere are some key differences between college essays and school essays:\n\nAudience and Purpose:\n\nSchool Essays: School essays are primarily written for teachers or instructors and are meant to demonstrate understanding of the subject matter, critical thinking skills, and the ability to communicate effectively. They often have a clear academic purpose, such as to answer a specific question or complete an assignment.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays are written for college admissions committees. Their primary purpose is to provide a personal, unique, and often reflective insight into the applicant's character, values, experiences, and aspirations. These essays aim to help admissions officers understand who the applicant is as an individual and why they would be a valuable addition to the college community.\n\nContent and Style:\n\nSchool Essays: School essays typically follow a structured, formal style, often using academic language and adhering to specific formatting guidelines (e.g., MLA or APA). They focus on presenting a clear argument or analysis of a particular topic, and the content is usually related to the course material or the assignment prompt.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays are more personal and narrative in nature. While they should still be well-structured and coherent, they allow for a more creative and individualized approach. These essays may touch on various topics, including personal experiences, challenges, accomplishments, and future goals. Creativity and authenticity are encouraged, making each essay unique.\n\nLength and Prompts:\n\nSchool Essays: School essays often have specific word counts or page limits the instructor sets. They typically respond to a particular question or prompt related to the course material.\n\nCollege Essays: College essay prompts can vary widely from one institution to another and may or may not have strict word limits. Some colleges offer a choice of essay prompts, allowing applicants to select the one that resonates most with their personal experiences and stories. This flexibility allows applicants to share what they consider most important.\n\nReview and Feedback:\n\nSchool Essays: Teachers or instructors typically review and grade school essays. Students may receive feedback on their writing and have the opportunity to revise and improve their work.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays are a critical part of the college application, and applicants often seek guidance and feedback from teachers, counselors, or writing coaches. Some colleges also offer resources for essay support. However, the essays should ultimately reflect the applicant's voice and experiences.\n\nTone and Voice:\n\nSchool Essays: A formal and academic tone is generally expected in school essays. Students are often encouraged to maintain a neutral and objective voice, focusing on presenting evidence and arguments logically and coherently. The emphasis is on demonstrating knowledge and critical thinking rather than revealing personal experiences or emotions.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays offer a unique opportunity for students to showcase their individuality, personality, and voice. While they should still be well-written and organized, they allow for a more personal and sometimes conversational tone. Admissions committees are interested in hearing the applicant's authentic voice and perspective, making storytelling and self-expression essential components.\n\nContent Focus:\n\nSchool Essays: School essays are typically centered around academic subjects and assignments. They often require research, citation of sources, and evidence-based arguments. The content is expected to be relevant to the course or studied topic.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays have a broader scope and may touch on various aspects of the applicant's life, such as personal experiences, values, cultural background, and aspirations. These essays may explore topics that are not strictly academic but are meaningful to the applicant's personal growth and character.\n\nEditing and Revising:\n\nSchool Essays: School essays are generally subject to multiple drafts and revisions, with feedback provided by teachers or professors. Students are encouraged to improve their writing skills through the revision process.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays also benefit from revision and editing, but the process may involve seeking feedback from multiple sources, including teachers, counselors, peers, and family members. It's common for students to revise their college essays several times to ensure they convey the desired message effectively.\n\nPurpose of Assessment:\n\nSchool Essays: In the context of school essays, assessment is primarily focused on evaluating students' comprehension of the subject matter, their ability to analyze and synthesize information, and their proficiency in academic writing.\n\nCollege Essays: The primary purpose of college essays is to provide admissions committees with a deeper understanding of the applicant as an individual. While the quality of writing is essential, these essays are evaluated in the context of the applicant's overall profile, including grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities.\n\nImpact on Decision-Making:\n\nSchool Essays: The impact of school essays is typically limited to the course or assignment for which they are written. They contribute to a student's academic record but generally do not influence decisions beyond the classroom.\n\nCollege Essays: College essays play a significant role in the college admissions process. They can be a decisive factor in whether an applicant is admitted to a college or university. Admissions committees use these essays to assess applicants' fit for the institution and their potential contributions to the campus community.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while both school and college essays involve writing, their purposes, styles, content, and audiences differ significantly. College essays provide applicants with a platform to express their individuality, share personal stories, and connect with admissions committees personally. These essays are a vital component of the holistic admissions process, allowing colleges to admit students with strong academic records and individuals who will contribute positively to the campus community. Therefore, crafting a compelling college essay is crucial in the college application journey.\n\nDiscussion Question:\nJoin the conversation and participate with the 24/7 College Admissions community by answering the DQ in the comment section below:\n\nIn addition to academic content, college essays often embrace personal narratives and unique experiences.

Click below.\nConquer Your Week: Planning and Execution\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nConquering Your Week with Planning and Execution.\n\nWe've all heard the phrase, \"plan your work, then work your plan.\" Yet, despite its wisdom, only about 1% of us actively put it into practice. That's like knowing the secret to winning a race but deciding to sit on the sidelines instead. What's up with that?\n\nLet's change the game, take control of our week, and bring our A-game every single day. Here's how.\n\nStage 1: Plan Your Week\nThe Power of 30-Minute Weekly Planning \n\nStart with a regular, 30-minute planning session. Think of it as your mission briefing for the week. By dedicating this time to plot your course, you'll set yourself up for success.\n\nHere's what you need to cover in your planning sesh:\n\nAllocate Time: Remember, you're the boss of your time. Plan where your hours will go before they're snapped up by something else.\n\nDemand/Supply: Weigh your resources against your responsibilities. What time and energy do you have available? How can you best apply them to meet your week's demands?\n\nInterrogate Your Calendar: Scour your schedule for time thieves. Do you really need that two-hour meeting, or could it be an email? Be ruthless and reclaim your time.\n\nRemove Resistance: Identify what might derail you from sticking to your plan, and brainstorm how you'll tackle it head-on.\n\nChoose Leveraged Priority: Decide on your most impactful task or goal for the week. This should be something that will drive your progress forward.\n\nTriage Your Task List: Prioritize your tasks. Which ones are critical? Which ones can be delegated or done later?\n\nStage 2: Work Your Plan \n\nYou've got your week mapped out, and it's time to hit the road. Here's how to navigate your journey effectively.\n\nDebug Your Mindset \n\nBeliefs and attitudes can make or break your ability to stick to your plan. If doubts or negative thoughts creep in, debug them with positive affirmations and a dose of self-belief.\n\nStop Distracting Yourself \n\nWe're often our own worst enemy when it comes to distractions. Be mindful of your habits and take steps to stay focused.\n\nBlock External Distractions \n\nThe world is full of potential distractions. Social media, emails, even well-meaning friends and family can disrupt your flow. Set boundaries to protect your focus.\n\nBuild Powerful Accountability \n\nFind an accountability partner, someone who will check in on your progress and help keep you on track. It could be a mentor, a friend, or a colleague. Just having someone else in your corner can make a huge difference.\n\nRemember, the real victory lies not in creating a perfect plan, but in persistently pursuing your plan, making adjustments along the way, and learning from the process. So, set your plan in motion, overcome your challenges, and conquer your week like a champ! \n\nAmplify Your Success: Further Tips to Conquer Your Week\n\nOkay, so you've nailed down your plan and learned how to work it like a boss. Now, let's dial up the volume and amplify your success. Here's how to take your weekly planning and execution game to the next level.\n\nStay Flexible and Adapt:\n\nWe've all heard it before: the only constant in life is change. Even the best-laid plans can be upended by unexpected developments. What do you do then? The answer is simple - stay flexible and adapt. If something isn't working, be prepared to switch gears and alter your plan. Remember, your plan is a guide, not a prison.\n\nCelebrate Your Wins: \n\nBig or small, every win is worth celebrating. Did you complete a difficult task? Did you stick to your plan despite temptations to veer off? Give yourself a pat on the back. This will not only boost your mood but also reinforce your positive habits.\n\nReflect and Learn: \n\nTake some time at the end of each week to reflect on what worked and what didn't. This isn't about dwelling on mistakes but about learning from them. Treat every experience as a stepping stone toward your ultimate success.\n\nLeverage Technology: \n\nConsider using apps or tools to help you plan and manage your time more effectively. From digital calendars to productivity apps, there are a ton of resources out there that can help you stick to your plan.\n\nPrioritize Self-Care: \n\nIn the hustle and bustle of getting things done, don't forget to take care of yourself. This means setting aside time for relaxation and doing things you enjoy. Remember, a healthy, happy you is the best asset for achieving your goals.\n\nIn the end, winning your week is all about taking control and making your time work for you. It's about navigating through life's challenges with grace, determination, and a sense of purpose. So, are you ready to level up and conquer your week? Let's do this! \n\nWrapping it Up - Mastering Your Week Like a Pro:\n\nAnd there you have it, friends! From planning to execution and all the steps in between, we've covered a comprehensive guide to conquer your week and amp up your productivity.\n\nRemember, planning isn't just about creating a list of tasks. It's about strategically aligning your time, resources, and energy with your goals. And when it comes to execution, it's about staying committed to your plan, maintaining a growth mindset, limiting distractions, and leveraging accountability.\n\nBut we didn't stop there, did we? We also explored how to amplify your success with flexibility, celebrating victories, reflecting and learning, leveraging tech, and prioritizing self-care. After all, you're not just aiming to check off tasks on your list but to grow and flourish as you do so.\n\nThe journey to mastering your week is not always easy, but with these tools and strategies in your arsenal, you're more than equipped to handle whatever comes your way. You'll be planning like a pro, executing like a champion, and amplifying your success like a rockstar.\n\nSo, as you stride into the week ahead, remember that you're in control. Take charge, make your plan, work your plan, and never forget to take care of the superstar that you are. Here's to winning our weeks and, ultimately, winning at life!\n\nAre you ready? Of course, you are! Let's conquer our weeks together! \n\nDid you know the earlier you start the college application process, the easier it is?

Click below.\nThe Power of Posing Questions: How to Outshine Everyone in the Room\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\n“The Quality of your questions equals the Quality of your Life.”\n\nEver sat in class and thought the 'know-it-all' is the most intelligent student? Well, let's debunk that myth today. Surprisingly, it's not the student with all the answers who shines the brightest but the one who's busy asking questions. Reminds me of a friend who's a perfect example of this—curious, insightful, and always asking why. Maybe she'll realize I'm talking about her and drop me a line!\n\nAsking questions isn't a sign of ignorance. In fact, it's the opposite. It proves that you're interested, involved, and eager to dig deeper. Instead of merely accepting information, you're actively hunting for knowledge and challenging what you've been told.\n\nNow, let's look at our 'know-it-all' friend. Although they seem to have all the answers, they might not be as smart as you think. They could be just repeating memorized facts or even just voicing their own biases (or, unfortunately, just enjoying the sound of their voice). It's great to have a solid understanding, but the cool thing about knowledge is that there's always more to discover. And remember, while learning, keep your 'game face' on to show that you're truly engaged!\n\nThe really smart people aren't afraid to admit when they don't know something. They're cool with not having all the answers and aren't scared to ask for help or learn from others. This sort of humility, along with the thirst to learn, is what sets them apart.\n\nAsking questions isn't just about you—it can help everyone around. Your questions can spark discussions and get others thinking more deeply about a topic. By asking, you're encouraging others to question their assumptions and explore different ideas. This can lead to a whole lot more learning for everyone. Look up #yesand—it's about accepting others' ideas and building on them!\n\nOf course, balance is key. You don't want to be that person who ONLY asks questions and doesn't contribute in other ways. But keep in mind, asking questions is a powerful way to show that you're a critical thinker and really involved.\n\nSo, the next time you're in a class, meeting, or even hanging out with friends, challenge yourself to ask at least one thought-provoking question. Don't be afraid to question your own beliefs and those of others. You might even start a new trend, inspiring others to ask more questions themselves!\n\nRemember, the smartest person in the room isn't the one who knows all the answers—it's the one who's always searching, always curious, always learning. So, are you ready to be the smartest person in your room?\n\nNow that we've got your curiosity sparked, let's dive deeper into how you can actually level up your question-asking game. Here's a cool toolkit that you can use to turn your curiosity into a superpower!\n\n1. Open-Ended Questions: This type of question can't be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. It encourages the person you're asking to give you more information. For example, instead of asking, \"Did you like the book?\" (which can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no'), ask \"What did you like about the book?\" This invites a deeper conversation and gives you more insight.\n\n2. The 5 Ws and How: Here's a fun way to make sure you're covering all your bases: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. These are essential for understanding any situation or topic thoroughly. So go ahead, get in the habit of exploring all angles!\n\n3. Reflective Questions: These types of questions make people think about their experiences and feelings. For example, \"How did it feel when you scored that goal?\" or \"What did you learn from losing the game?\" They can help you, and the person you're talking to, understand their experiences better.\n\n4. Probing Questions: These are like follow-up questions. They're useful when you want to understand something better or get more detail. For example, if a friend mentions a problem, you could ask, \"Can you tell me more about that?\"\n\n5. Hypothetical Questions: These are questions about things that haven't happened but could. They help people think creatively and understand their feelings or thoughts better. For instance, \"What would you do if you won the lottery?\"\n\nNow, here are some hacks to make your question-asking even better:\n\n1. Be Genuine: People can tell if you're asking a question just to ask it. Make sure you're really interested in the answer. Pay attention when the other person is speaking.\n\n2. Be Clear and Simple: Make sure your questions are easy to understand. You don't want people getting confused!\n\n3. Make it Safe: Create a space where people feel comfortable being honest. This means showing respect and not judging their answers.\n\n4. Patience is Key: Give people time to think and respond. Don't rush them or keep interrupting with more questions.\n\nIn essence, becoming the smartest person in the room is about developing a deep sense of curiosity and learning how to ask effective questions. By doing this, you'll not only increase your own knowledge and understanding but also foster a more enriching environment for those around you.\n\nSo, are you ready to shake things up with your questions? Trust me, it's a game-changer. And who knows, you might even inspire your friends to start their own journey of curiosity. So, what's your next question going to be?\n\nDid you know early intervention in academic challenges can make all the difference?

Click below.\nSupercharge Your Study Techniques: Applying the Pareto Principle for Efficient Learning\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nSupercharge Your Study Techniques: Applying the Pareto Principle for Efficient Learning:\n\nThe world of academics is not devoid of life's inherent principles. One of these principles, the Pareto Principle or the 80/20 rule, is as germane to study techniques as it is to the spheres of economics and business. Today, we delve into this principle and explore how it can enhance your study outcomes.\n\nThe Pareto Principle, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, posits that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In the context of studying, this suggests that 80% of your learning results are derived from 20% of your studying tasks. Identifying and focusing on this crucial 20% is key to an efficient and effective learning strategy.\n\nGrasping the Pareto Principle\n\nTo truly harness the power of the Pareto Principle, one must first fully understand it. This principle is premised on a skewed balance, the quintessential 80/20 ratio that illustrates disproportionate effects. It is crucial to note that this ratio is not fixed but represents a typical distribution: a small number of causes often result in a majority of the effects.\n\nIn a study context, the principle suggests that a significant chunk of what you learn or retain comes from a smaller proportion of your overall study efforts. The challenge, then, lies in identifying and focusing on these high-impact activities.\n\nIdentifying Your High-Impact Activities\n\nHow do you identify the activities that form the critical 20%? Start by cataloging your study tasks. These could be reading textbooks, watching instructional videos, attending lectures, note-taking, doing homework, or group study sessions. Next, assess each activity's impact on your understanding and retention of the course material.\n\nOften, activities that require active engagement—like problem-solving or teaching others—yield higher returns than passive activities like rereading notes. However, individual preferences and the nature of the subject matter can sway this balance. Therefore, reflecting honestly on which tasks help you comprehend and remember best is essential.\n\nOptimizing Your Study Techniques\n\nOnce you've identified your high-impact activities, restructure your study routine around them. Channel more time and energy into these tasks. For instance, if you find that discussing topics with classmates in a study group dramatically improves your understanding, allocate more time to such interactions.\n\nAt the same time, consider how you can make lower-impact activities more effective. If rereading notes offers little help, can you transform this passive process into an active one by summarizing the content or forming questions as you read?\n\nApplying Pareto to Time Management\n\nTime management is an integral part of studying. Here, too, the Pareto Principle can be instrumental. Analyze your typical study day. Do you find that you're more productive at certain times? Perhaps your concentration peaks during the early morning or evening hours. That's your high-impact 20%.\n\nCapitalize on these productive periods by scheduling challenging tasks or high-impact study activities during these times. Conversely, use your less productive times for low-impact tasks or necessary breaks.\n\nA Balanced Approach\n\nDespite the efficacy of the Pareto Principle, remember that it should not be used to eliminate 80% of your activities entirely. The goal is to optimize your efforts, not to cut corners. The 80% of your tasks that contribute to 20% of your results still play a role in your overall understanding and should not be disregarded.\n\nMoreover, some topics or subjects might require a different approach or a varied combination of study techniques. Stay flexible and adaptable, adjusting your strategy as required.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe Pareto Principle, when judiciously applied, can transform your approach to studying. It shifts the focus from mere quantity to quality, from broad efforts to targeted tasks that yield the most significant returns.\n\nEmbracing this principle requires introspection, trial and error, and continual adjustment. You might not hit the bullseye on the first try, but don’t let that discourage you. The more you explore and understand your study habits, the more effectively you'll be able to apply this principle.\n\nBe patient with the process. Remember, it's about amplifying productivity, not about stringent adherence to the 80/20 split. The Pareto Principle serves as a tool for self-discovery, spotlighting the power of focused effort in a world that often equates busyness with productivity.\n\nAlso, consider the role of rest within this principle. If sleep and downtime fall within your 20% of causes that lead to 80% of your productivity, don't neglect them. Instead, honor the critical part they play in your cognitive processes and overall well-being. Remember, we're seeking sustainable study habits, not burnout.\n\nUltimately, the Pareto Principle can foster a paradigm shift in your approach to learning. By identifying and focusing on high-impact tasks, you can reduce stress, increase comprehension, and make your study time more productive. This principle, though simple in concept, can be truly transformational in practice. Harness its potential and elevate your study techniques to new, unprecedented heights.\n\nWhile the Pareto Principle is an empowering guideline, it's essential to remember that everyone's 20% can look different. Your 'magic 20%' depends on your learning style, subject matter, and personal circumstances. Hence, you should continually tailor and refine your approach for optimal results.\n\nIn the journey of education, the Pareto Principle is a compass, not a map. It can guide you towards efficiency, but the terrain you traverse is uniquely yours. Use this principle as a tool to better navigate your educational journey, illuminating a pathway to more effective and efficient learning.\n\nDid you know early intervention in academic challenges can make all the difference?

Click below.\nUnlocking Academic Success: How Active Retrieval Can Revolutionize Your Study Techniques\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nHow Active Retrieval Can Revolutionize Your Study Techniques:\n\nIf you're a student eager to optimize your study habits or a parent looking for proven methods to improve your teen's academic performance, you've landed on the right page. From years of experience and scientific backing, Active Retrieval consistently ranks as one of the most effective study techniques. In this blog post, we'll delve into why this is the case, answer common questions about studying in high school, and offer tips on how to focus 100% on your studies.\n\nWhat is Active Retrieval?\n\nActive Retrieval is a cognitive strategy that actively stimulates memory recall during learning. Active Retrieval encourages true understanding, unlike passive review methods like re-reading or underlining, which may create a 'feeling' of familiarity with the material. It requires the learner to actively stimulate memory recall and engage cognitive functions, deepening the memory trace associated with the specific material.\n\nHow Does Active Retrieval Work?\n\nTo break it down, here are several effective ways to practice active Retrieval:\n\nSelf-testing: Challenge yourself with questions about the material and try to answer them without looking at the source material.\n\nFlashcards: Use flashcards with questions on one side and answers on the other. Go through the deck and try to recall the answers.\n\nRetrieval Practice: Regularly practice recalling information from memory. This can take the form of practice quizzes or even oral recitation.\n\nTeaching Others: Try explaining a concept or set of facts to someone else without looking at your notes. When you can teach something, you understand it.\n\nWhy Active Retrieval is the Most Effective Study Technique\n\nSeveral research studies have indicated that Active Retrieval is highly effective at enhancing long-term retention of information. Unlike re-reading or merely reviewing notes, Active Retrieval forces the brain to recall and reconstruct knowledge, thereby strengthening neural pathways. It pushes the student to engage with the material on a deeper cognitive level, helping to solidify the information in long-term memory.\n\nSo, why should you incorporate this technique into your study regimen? The answer is simple: it has proven efficacy in improving retention and understanding, elevating academic performance. But don't just take our word for it—our teen academic performance and accountability coaching services have helped hundreds of students leverage this and other effective study methods to unlock their full academic potential.\n\nEffective Study Habits for High School Students\n\nHigh school students often juggle various responsibilities, including academics, extracurricular activities, and social commitments. Developing effective study habits is crucial for maintaining a balance and excelling academically. Here are some tips tailored specifically for high school students:\n\nTime Management: Utilize planners or digital scheduling tools to keep track of assignments and study sessions.\n\nConsistent Study Schedule: Consistency is vital. Designate specific times for studying to build a routine.\n\nPrioritize Tasks: Not all assignments are created equal. Use a prioritization method like the Eisenhower Box to manage tasks efficiently.\n\nStudy Environment: Create a study environment free from distractions. This will help you focus better and maximize your study time.\n\nBest Ways to Study for a Test in High School\n\nExams can be stressful, but knowing how to prepare can make all the difference. If you're a high school student or a parent looking for effective test preparation methods, these tips are for you:\n\nStart Early: Begin your preparation well in advance to avoid last-minute cramming. This will enable more efficient memory encoding and retention.\n\nDistributed Practice: Spread your study sessions over a period of time. Numerous studies have shown this approach to be more effective than massed practice, commonly known as cramming.\n\nMix it Up: Use various study resources such as textbooks, online tutorials, and flashcards. This is known as 'Interleaved Learning,' it can be more effective than sticking to one type of learning resource.\n\nUse Active Retrieval: As discussed earlier, incorporating Active Retrieval techniques, such as self-quizzing and teaching the material to someone else, can dramatically improve your understanding and retention.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques into your study habits, you prepare for your test effectively and build skills that will be useful throughout your academic journey and beyond. You can dive deeper into this topic by reading our blog post on the most effective ways to study.\n\nHow to Achieve 100% Focus While Studying\n\nIn the digital age, distractions are just a click away. Achieving complete focus during study sessions can be challenging but is crucial for effective learning. Here's how you can enhance your focus:\n\nSet Specific Goals: Before each study session, write down your goal. Having a clear objective can help you stay focused.\n\nEliminate Distractions: Turn off notifications on your devices or keep them in another room while you study.\n\nPomodoro Technique: Work in bursts of intense focus (usually 25 minutes) followed by a short break. This can help maintain your attention level and prevent burnout.\n\nMindfulness: Simple mindfulness exercises can help you become aware of your thoughts and prevent your mind from wandering.\n\nRegular Monitoring and Feedback: The 24/7 Teach Difference\n\nAchieving academic excellence requires more than just effective study techniques. 24/7 Teach offers academic and accountability coaching based on the \"Learn, Do, Be\" model.

Click below.\nThe Power of Interleaving: A Revolutionary Approach to Studying and Learning\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nA Revolutionary Approach to Studying and Learning:\n\nAre you a student who feels your current studying methods are leaving you unmotivated and displeased with your academic performance? This post is meant to help provide some additional support and alleviate some of the common issues many students face in attempting to learn valuable skills in challenging courses. \n\nThe Interleaving Study Technique is a unique and proven educational strategy that has been noted for enhancing memory retention and improving learning outcomes. Unlike traditional block learning methods, where a single topic is studied extensively before moving on to the next, interleaving involves mixing different topics or types of problems within a single study session. This approach has been proven to enhance problem-solving skills and improve long-term retention of information. For instance, a study published in the 'Journal of Educational Psychology' found that students who used interleaving performed significantly better on math problems compared to those who used blocked study methods.\n\nWhat are the Principles of Interleaving?\n\nInterleaving is grounded in several key principles that differentiate it from traditional learning methods:\n\nVariation: By mixing various topics, students are exposed to a wider range of concepts in a single session, preventing over-familiarity with any one subject.\n\nSpacing Effect: Interleaving inherently incorporates spaced repetition, a technique where learning is spread out over time, leading to better memory retention.\n\nDiscrimination Learning: It encourages learners to compare and contrast different concepts, enhancing their ability to distinguish between them.\n\nWhat is the Interleaving Model?\n\nThe interleaving model can be visualized as a dynamic approach to studying where multiple subjects or problem types are woven together in an alternating pattern. For example, in a math study session, instead of focusing solely on algebra for an hour, a student might spend 20 minutes on algebra, followed by 20 minutes on geometry, and then 20 minutes on statistics. This model promotes cognitive flexibility, forcing the brain to adapt and apply different strategies continually.\n\nWhat is the Theory of Interleaving?\n\nAt its core, the interleaving theory is based on the concept that learning is more effective when our brains are challenged to retrieve and apply different pieces of information. This contrasts with block learning, where the focus is on mass repetition of a single topic, leading to a superficial understanding that may not be durable over time. The interleaving theory suggests that by engaging in a more challenging and varied study method, learners develop a deeper and more robust understanding of the material.\n\nView fullsize\n\nClick here to enlarge\n\nIncorporating Interleaving into Your Study Routine\n\nUnderstanding the benefits and principles of interleaving is one thing; applying them is another. Here's how you can integrate this technique into your study routine:\n\nMix Your Subjects: Plan your study sessions to include multiple subjects or topics. If you're focusing on history, mix in some literature or science to challenge your brain to switch gears and apply different thinking styles.\n\nUse Varied Problem Types: If studying a single subject, like mathematics, work on different types of problems within the same session. This can help in developing a broader understanding of the subject.\n\nCreate a Routine: Set aside time in your daily routine to dedicate to interleaved sessions. Regularly switch between different subjects or topics to maintain the effectiveness of this technique.\n\nSelf-Test Frequently: Testing yourself on the material you've studied in an interleaved manner can further enhance memory retention and understanding.\n\nBenefits of Interleaving\n\nThe interleaving technique offers several benefits:\n\nImproved Retention: By constantly switching topics, your brain has to work harder to recall and apply information, leading to better long-term retention.\n\nEnhanced Problem-Solving Skills: Interleaving helps develop the ability to discern and apply different approaches to various problems.\n\nAdaptability: This method trains your brain to adapt to new and changing situations, a valuable skill in both academic and real-world challenges.\n\nSelf Evaluation:\n\nTo truly understand the effectiveness of interleaving, it's crucial to evaluate its impact on your learning. This can be done through self-assessment, tracking grades or performance over time, or seeking feedback from educators or peers. Reflecting on how interleaving has changed your approach to studying and the results you've achieved can provide valuable insights and motivation to continue using this technique.\n\nChallenges and Overcoming Them:\n\nWhile the benefits of interleaving are clear, it's not without its challenges. Initially, this method can feel more difficult than traditional study techniques, and it may take time to see the results. However, persistence is important. Try to embrace the challenge as part of the learning process, and remember that the initial difficulty is a sign that your brain is engaging and learning in a deeper, more effective way. Instead of attempting to change your studying habits immediately, try gradually increasing the frequency and complexity of the sessions as you become more comfortable with the technique. This method can result in a deeper understanding of the material and help students who are struggling start to see a real difference in return for their commitment. \n\nCustomizing Interleaving for Your Learning Style:\n\nIt's important to recognize that every learner is unique, and the one-size-fits-all approach does not apply to studying. Interleaving can be customized to suit different learning styles. For visual learners, interleaving can involve switching between various visual materials; for kinesthetic learners, it can include applying concepts through hands-on activities. Understanding and adapting interleaving to individual preferences can maximize its effectiveness and make learning more enjoyable.\n\nInterleaving in Different Disciplines:\n\nInterleaving's versatility allows it to be applied across various disciplines, each with its unique set of challenges and content. For example, in subjects like mathematics, interleaving can help students discern different problem-solving methods. In languages, it can aid in learning grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation by constantly switching between these areas. Similarly, in the sciences, interleaving different concepts or experiments can provide a more holistic understanding of the subject matter.\n\nTailoring Interleaving to Individuals\n\nThe beauty of interleaving lies in its adaptability to individual learning goals. Whether you're preparing for a standardized test, mastering a new language, or pursuing a personal interest, interleaving can be tailored to meet specific objectives. By strategically planning your study sessions to cover a range of topics relevant to your goals, you can maximize the benefits of this technique.\n\nUtilizing Resources \n\nIn an age where technology permeates every aspect of our lives, leveraging digital tools to facilitate the interleaving study technique can be incredibly effective. Educational apps and online platforms can help structure study sessions with interleaving in mind, offering a range of topics and problem types at your fingertips. Online course programs such as 24/7 Teach’s Lesson 4: Learning How to Learn Workshop are accessible resources meant to help students leverage new learning techniques. Utilizing these tools not only simplifies the process of interleaving but also adds an element of engagement and interactivity to the learning experience.\n\nReal Impacts and Applications\n\nThere are numerous success stories where interleaving has made a significant impact. Students who have adopted this technique often report improved grades and a deeper understanding of the material.  Not only is interleaving valuable in academic learning, it has practical applications in various fields. In professional settings, interleaving can help individuals develop a diverse skill set, making them more adaptable and efficient in their roles. These stories serve as a testament to the power of interleaving in transforming the learning experience in many different contexts.\n\nInterleaving as a Lifelong Learning Strategy:\n\nInterleaving is not just a study technique for academic purposes; it's also a strategy for lifelong learning. By continually challenging the brain with varied learning experiences, interleaving can help maintain cognitive agility and curiosity throughout life. This approach to learning encourages a continuous exploration of new topics and ideas, keeping the mind active and engaged.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe interleaving study technique represents a significant shift from traditional study methods, offering a more dynamic and effective approach to learning. Its benefits, including improved retention, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, make it an invaluable tool in the arsenal of any student or educator. As a committed and ambitious student, a full course load can often be intimidating and overwhelming. Still, a method like interleaving is meant to help alleviate some of this stress and produce real results.

Click below.\nWhy Your Teen Should Start Leadership Training Now\nPowered by 24/7 Teach\n \nDownload\nEmpowering the Next Generation: The Indispensable Value of Teen Leadership Training:\n\nAs a Teen Leadership Coach, I've witnessed the transformative power of leadership training firsthand. It's an experience that goes beyond the rudiments of traditional learning, touching the core of what makes a young individual a future leader and a force of positive change. But why should your teen consider leadership training? Let's delve into the pressing reasons.\n\n1. Building a Solid Foundation for the Future:\n\nThe teenage years are a formative period. They are years of identity formation, where habits, skills, and mindsets get deeply ingrained. Leadership training at this stage is a foundational layer, providing teens with skills and attitudes that stay with them throughout life. These competencies—like decision-making, conflict resolution, and effective communication—are relevant for leadership roles and universally applicable, setting your teen up for success in any professional or personal arena.\n\n2. Fostering Emotional Intelligence:\n\nIn a rapidly changing world, emotional intelligence (EQ) is gaining ground as an essential quality. Leadership training prioritizes EQ, teaching teens to understand, express, and manage emotions. Additionally, they learn to recognize emotions in others, enhancing their empathy and ability to navigate interpersonal relationships seamlessly.\n\n3. Cultivating Critical Thinking:\n\nLeadership is not about being the loudest in the room; it's about being the most thoughtful. Leadership programs emphasize critical thinking, encouraging teens to analyze situations, understand various perspectives, and develop innovative solutions. This cognitive development serves them in leadership scenarios and everyday challenges, from academics to personal choices.\n\n4. Enhancing Self-confidence:\n\nWhile many teens grapple with self-esteem issues, leadership training instills a sense of self-worth. They believe in their capabilities because they are entrusted with responsibilities, given feedback, and encouraged to make decisions. This newfound confidence translates to other areas of their lives, from acing an interview for a part-time job to standing up for their beliefs.\n\n5. Learning the Value of Teamwork:\n\nLeadership isn't a solo act. In leadership programs, teens work collaboratively, understanding the dynamics of teamwork. They learn the importance of diverse viewpoints, how to harness individual strengths for a collective goal, and the art of motivation. Whether your teen aspires to lead a company, a community project, or a sports team, these lessons are invaluable.\n\n6. Establishing a Purpose-driven Mindset:\n\nOne of the hallmarks of great leaders is a sense of purpose. Leadership training nudges teens to reflect on their values, passions, and vision. As they align their actions with a larger purpose, they find direction and inspire others to join their cause. This purpose-driven approach ensures that they're not just chasing success but are striving for significance.\n\n7. Preparing for Real-world Challenges:\n\nWhile textbooks teach theory, leadership programs present real-world challenges. From project management to conflict resolution, teens face situations that mimic future workplace or community challenges. This hands-on experience is invaluable, preparing them for what lies ahead and giving them an edge in college and career pursuits.\n\n8. Building a Network of Like-minded Peers:\n\nLeadership programs often bring together a cohort of ambitious, forward-thinking teens. The relationships formed here can evolve into lifelong friendships or professional collaborations. This network can provide support, advice, and opportunity in the Future.\n\n9. Nurturing Ethical Decision-Making:\n\nEthical leadership stands as a beacon of hope in an era where lines often blur between right and wrong. Leadership training isn't just about the 'how,' and the 'why'’ Teens learn the importance of values, integrity, and ethical decision-making. They are taught to weigh the consequences of their actions, not just for themselves but for the larger community. This moral foundation is pivotal, especially in today's complex world where choices aren't always black and white.\n\n10. Encouraging Adaptability and Resilience:\n\nChange is the only constant, and in our dynamic world, adaptability is critical. Leadership programs present scenarios where plans change and unexpected challenges arise. Navigating these teaches teens resilience. They learn that failure isn't the end but a stepping stone. This adaptability and resilience make them strong leaders and individuals who can weather life's storms with grace.\n\n11. Amplifying Communication Skills:\n\nWhile digital communication is second nature to today's teens, effective interpersonal communication is an art that needs honing. Leadership training focuses on refining this art. Teens practice active listening, assertive yet respectful articulation, and non-verbal communication. Whether it's rallying a team, presenting an idea, or handling difficult conversations, these skills ensure they communicate with clarity and conviction.\n\n12. Providing a Safe Space for Self-Discovery:\n\nIn leadership programs, teens step out of their comfort zones. They take on roles they've never tried, face challenges they've never imagined, and question beliefs they've always held. This environment becomes a safe space for self-discovery. They understand their strengths, work on their weaknesses, and, most importantly, figure out the kind of leaders they aspire to be.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe journey from adolescence to adulthood is filled with myriad challenges, questions, and moments of self-doubt. However, with the right guidance and training, it can also be a period of immense growth, self-awareness, and empowerment. Leadership training is more than a program; it's an investment into the Future — of the individual, the community, and the world at large. As we guide our teens towards these opportunities, we're not just shaping future leaders but laying the foundation for a brighter, more responsible, and more compassionate world.\n\nBefore You Embark on Your Journey...
